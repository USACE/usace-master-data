terms:
- label: Federal project
  definition: A project constructed by the Corps, and subsequently turned over to
    a local sponsor for operations and maintenance responsibility. This definition
    also includes any project specifically designated as a Federal project by an Act
    of Congress.
- label: 'Flood control project: A project designed and constructed to have appreciable
    and dependable effects in preventing damage from irregular and unusual rises in
    water level'
  definition: For a multipurpose project, only those components that are necessary
    for the flood control function are considered eligible for Rehabilitation Assistance.
- label: Governor
  definition: 'All references in part 203 to the Governor of a State also refer to:
    the Governors of United States commonwealths, territories, and possessions; and
    the Mayor of Washington, D.C.'
- label: Hurricane/Shore Protection Project (HSPP)
  altName: [ HSPP ]
  definition: A flood control project designed and constructed to have appreciable
    and predictable effects in preventing damage to developed areas from the impacts
    of hurricanes, tsunamis, and coastal storms. These effects are primarily to protect
    against wave action, storm surge, wind, and the complicating factors of extraordinary
    high tides. HSPP's include projects known as shore protection projects, shore
    protection structures, periodic nourishment projects, shore enhancement projects,
    and similar terms. Components of an HSPP may include both hard (permanent construction)
    and soft (sacrificial, i.e., sand) features.
- label: Non-Federal project
  definition: A project constructed with non-Federal funds, or a project constructed
    by tribal, State, local, or private interests, or a component of such a project.
    A project constructed under Federal emergency disaster authorities, such as Public
    Law 84-99 or the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act,
    as amended (42 U.S.C. 5121, et seq.) (hereinafter referred to as the Stafford
    Act), is a non-Federal project unless it repairs or replaces an existing Federal
    project. Works Progress Administration (WPA) projects, and projects funded completely
    or partially by other (non-Corps) Federal agencies, are considered non-Federal
    projects for the application of Public Law 84-99 authority.
- label: Non-Federal sponsor
  definition: A non-Federal sponsor is a public entity that is a legally constituted
    public body with full authority and capability to perform the terms of its agreement
    as the non-Federal partner of the Corps for a project, and able to pay damages,
    if necessary, in the event of its failure to perform. A non-Federal sponsor may
    be a State, County, City, Town, Federally recognized Indian Tribe or tribal organization,
    Alaska Native Corporation, or any political subpart of a State or group of states
    that has the legal and financial authority and capability to provide the necessary
    cash contributions and LERRD's necessary for the project.
- label: Repair and rehabilitation
  definition: "The term repair and rehabilitation means the repair or rebuilding of\
    \ a flood control structure, after the structure has been damaged by a flood,\
    \ hurricane, or coastal storm, to the level of protection provided by the structure\
    \ prior to the flood, hurricane, or coastal storm. Repair and rehabilitation\
    \ does not include improvements (betterments) to the structure, nor does repair\
    \ and rehabilitation include any repair or rebuilding of a flood control\
    \ structure that, in the normal course of usage, has become structurally unsound\
    \ and is no longer fit to provide the level of protection for which it was designed."
