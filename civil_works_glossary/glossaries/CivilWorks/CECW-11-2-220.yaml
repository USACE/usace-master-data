terms:
- label: Activity
  definition:  A component of work performed during the course of a project. An activity
    could be a process (e.g. Collection of data) or lead to a deliverable (write a
    report). Activities are the building blocks of the CWIF-D system they have
    assigned durations, resources, and relationships.
- label: Benefit Cost Ratio
  altName: [ BCR ]
  definition: 'A benefit-cost analysis which is performed to calculate and compare
    benefits and costs for a project to determine whether the project is a sound investment
    (justification/feasibility) and to see how it compares with other competing projects
    (ranking/priority assignment). BCR computations must be based on benefits in the
    latest approved economic analysis and must be no older than 3 years for New Start
    construction projects and no more than five years for continuing construction
    projects. Note distinctions of the different BCRs below:

    - BCR AT APPLICABLE RATE: The BCR is the ratio of benefits to costs of all project
    purposes, from the last approved report or updated for budget purposes, evaluated
    at the applicable discount rate. If the BCR is not reported, put NA in the field
    and explain why in the REMARKS.

    - BCR Current “The BCR with most current updated costs/benefits.

    - BCR @ 7% - Using a discount rate allows for comparison of benefits and costs
    accruing at different points in time. The benefit-cost analysis uses discounting
    procedures to normalize financial outcomes over time.

    - BCR National Economic Development Plan (BCR-NED) “ The objective in formulating
    the National Economic Development Plan is to maximize the difference between monetized
    benefits and costs. Benefits are increases in the net value of national outputs
    (goods and services) and vary by type of water resource project. The costs (opportunity
    costs) are the costs of the resources required or displaced to achieve the plan,
    such as concrete and steel for building a floodwall.

    - BCR “ Locally Preferred Plan (BCR-LPP) “ A Sponsor may support formulation
    of an alternative plan with a scope that results in a decrease in the difference
    between monetized benefits and costs compared to the National Economic Development
    Plan'
- label: Capability
  definition: "Capability is defined as the estimate for the amount of additional,\
    \ new funding (over and above projected or actual unobligated carry-in) that,\
    \ if provided in the applicable fiscal year, can either be obligated or committed\
    \ for a contract solicitation effectively and efficiently in that fiscal year,\
    \ consistent with law and policy, assuming that all projected or actual uncommitted\
    \ carry-in to that fiscal year is obligated or committed first. (not to be confused\
    \ with definition for Enterprise-Wide Capability)\n- Capability on a contract\
    \ work package proposed for funding in the BY does not include out- year costs\
    \ of engineering and design (E&D), supervision and administration (S&A), or contingencies\
    \ on the contract. The exception is that out-year E&D, S&A, and contingencies\
    \ should be included if the BY is the last year that contracts are planned to\
    \ be funded on the project or the study phase, since in this case including them\
    \ would enable full funding of the project or phase. Furthermore, once the allocations\
    \ in the President's Budget for a given FY (which becomes BY-1) have been finalized,\
    \ the capability estimate for an unbudgeted, fully funded contract work package\
    \ should be adjusted to include out-year E&D, S&A, and contingencies, among other\
    \ adjustments, because future-FY funding is not certain if the unbudgeted work\
    \ package is funded in a BY-1 work plan.\n- Capability is stated in terms of\
    \ obligations and commitments for contract solicitations, not expenditures. Capability\
    \ and Amount That Could Be Used are identical, where used means\
    \ obligated or committed for a contract solicitation. Project capability for a\
    \ FY is the sum of its work package capabilities for that FY."
- label: Caretaker Status
  definition: "Real or personal property at a project site, in part or in whole that\
    \ is currently not utilized or occupied for current program authorized purposes.\
    \ This status is applied to inactive assets (see Inactive Facility) for which\
    \ there are no reactivation plans. Facility systems and collateral equipment may\
    \ be considered for excess; corresponding to the Federal Real Property Indicator\
    \ status excess and dispose. Caretaker status is distinct from\
    \ standby or mothball status and is defined at the project or\
    \ project site level, not the feature level."

- label: Civil Works Integrated Funding Database
  altName: [ CW-IFD, CWIFD ]
  definition: 'CW-IFD is defined as the integrated data set for supporting budget
    allocations and related funding decisions. CW-IFD includes data used to support
    the following processes:

    - Budget development

    - Work plan development/Allocation Strategy

    - Documentation and decisions on funding emergency repairs

    - Authoritative data on project authorization and cost, to facilitate life cycle
    cost management, deauthorization, and portfolio management

    Data is organized into one of three general categories: - Program or Project
    data

    - Facility or Feature data

    - Work package data'
  anchor: '273'
- label: Common Operation and Maintenance
  definition: "Includes work that is commonly performed at similar projects such as\
    \ operation at all performance levels, preventive maintenance, budget development,\
    \ financial and execution management, environmental monitoring and mitigation,\
    \ and other things necessary to support operation, recurring maintenance, and\
    \ small scale corrective maintenance of the project. Budget requests for O&M in\
    \ this category do not resource O&M work which is necessary to support facility\
    \ performance in future budget years. Common O&M includes work in programmatic\
    \ activities, administrative and technical support, and legal & environmental\
    \ mandates. Common O&M is distinct from Specific Work Activities in budget formulation.\
    \ Common O&M is separated into three Buckets: Programmatic Activities,\
    \ which are activities performed by personnel located at the physical project\
    \ site; Administrative and Technical Support, which are activities performed by\
    \ personnel not located at the physical project site (e.g., District Office, Area\
    \ Office, etc.); and Legal and Environmental Mandates, which includes all legal\
    \ and environmental mandates (e.g., NAGPRA, BiOps, NEPA, etc.)."
  anchor: '272'
- label: Component Renewal
  definition: The renewal or replacement of major asset components (roofs, large HVAC,
    lock gates and mechanisms, spillways gates, etc.). The work almost always exceeds
    Capital thresholds and generally has a frequency of greater than seven to ten
    years but is not a capital improvement.
  anchor: '272'
- label: Corrective Maintenance
  definition: The repair or renewal of an item which has failed or is about to fail.
  anchor: '272'
- label: Critical Infrastructure Protection & Resilience Program
  definition: The CIPR program leads risk assessment and prioritization efforts for
    USACE critical infrastructure portfolio in order to enhance its protection and
    resilience. The program includes both common actions (security and operations
    personnel training, security patrol and monitoring, security equipment maintenance,
    security risk assessments, blast damage assessment studies, dam security exercises,
    operating interim risk reduction measures, and physical security inspections)
    and Specific Work Activities (protection and operational interim risk reduction
    measures, physical security implementation, construction retrofits/hardening for
    vulnerability mitigation, surge in protective measures due to increased threat
    levels). For more information, see Annex III, paragraph III-2-7.
  anchor: '273'
- label: Critical Work Activities/Packages
  definition: "Each MSC is responsible for evaluating individual work activities/packages\
    \ to determine their level of importance with regard to funding in the BY budget.\
    \ In addition, MSCs must be able to fully justify work activities/packages that\
    \ are identified as \"critical\" to their needs. The supporting justification\
    \ for critical work activities/packages must demonstrate failure to perform the\
    \ work would be critical to the functioning of the project to accomplish its mission;\
    \ would endanger the health and safety of the public or project employees, or\
    \ would result in substantial losses. Equipment, assets, facilities or components\
    \ where failure would directly impede the accomplishment of the assigned mission;\
    \ would endanger the health and safety of the public or project employees; or\
    \ would result in substantial losses are considered critical assets. The justification\
    \ for critical work activities/packages must be supported by a risk vs consequence\
    \ type analysis. All \"operation\", \"maintenance\" and \"joint cost\"\
    \ work activities/packages in the budget that are identified as \"critical\",\
    \ whether Common O&M or Specific Work Activities, should be capable of meeting\
    \ this requirement. "
  anchor: '272'
- label: Cyclical Maintenance
  definition: The replacement or renewal of items that are required on a recurring
    basis, with a frequency of greater than one year and less than seven to ten years.
    Examples are channel dredging, painting, floor coverings, engine overhauls, etc.
    These generally fall below Capital thresholds. These are also the items that are
    frequently deferred. Cyclical Maintenance is also referred to as Recurring Maintenance.
  anchor: '273'
- label: Enterprise-Wide Capability for Allocation Strategy
  definition: "Enterprise-wide capability, or execution capacity, is the maximum amount\
    \ of project capabilities that the MSC or FOA can execute in the applicable fiscal\
    \ year. It is recognized that each enterprise, while it can execute the project\
    \ capabilities on some of its projects, cannot execute the project capabilities\
    \ on all of its projects. Enterprise-wide capability is less than the sum of project\
    \ capabilities. Appropriations Committee staffs are interested in USACE enterprise-\
    \ wide capabilities, particularly by business line or line item of additional\
    \ funding, for the allocation Strategy (BY-1). This paragraph provides guidance\
    \ on how each MSC or FOA states its enterprise-wide capability in the Allocation\
    \ Strategy.\n(i) The Explanatory Statements accompanying recent energy and water\
    \ development appropriations acts have provided line items of additional funding\
    \ that span all authorized business lines and functions, including those of lower\
    \ budget priority such as bank protection and environmental infrastructure. Accordingly,\
    \ enterprise-wide capability should represent a balanced mix of business lines\
    \ and functions. In other words, within each business line or function a reasonable\
    \ portion of work packages should be within enterprise-wide capability, and others\
    \ should be beyond enterprise-wide capability. The mix is more or less governed\
    \ by expectations (based on recent Explanatory Statements and House and Senate\
    \ Reports) for funding of budgeted work and the line items of additional funding.\
    \ (ii) The MSC or FOA should use performance to determine, within each business\
    \ line or function, which work packages are within enterprise capability, and\
    \ which are not. All budgeted work packages should be first-added within enterprise\
    \ capability, and unbudgeted work packages should be next-added.\n(iii) The MSC\
    \ or FOA should signify which work packages are within enterprise-wide capability,\
    \ or not, by checking the \"Funding Pot\" box, or not, in the \"Recommended for\
    \ Funding\" field under the Funding tab in the Civil Works Integrated\
    \ Funding Database (CWIFD). To respond to Congressional inquiries for USACE-wide\
    \ enterprise capability for a business line or function, HQUSACE will aggregate\
    \ across USACE the capabilities of work packages in that business line or function\
    \ that have the Funding Pot box checked."

- label: Facility Operation
  definition: The day-to-day activities that allow for the continued use of facilities
    but are not considered part of the maintenance regimen that directly extends the
    life of the asset, facility or component. Examples include things such as security,
    custodial services, removing ice and snow, mowing, debris, trash, cleaning; or
    replacing lighting fixtures.
  anchor: '274'
- label: FEM Work Order Number
  altName: [ WON, FEM WON ]
  definition: 'A FEM WON is an alpha-numeric field from the FEM (Facilities and Equipment
    Maintenance) program that is a unique identifier connecting the budget work package
    to budget execution via the USACE Facilities and Equipment Management system (FEM).
    A FEM WON is required for all Specific Work Activity budget work packages in CWIF-D
    for all BLs and should be assigned at the appropriate asset level. Note that a
    data field has been established in CWIF-D for entering the FEM WON. Selection
    of the specific work order numbering schema is at the discretion of the activity
    submitting the budget work package. All project deficiencies and needs captured
    on FEM Work orders, according to Phase 3 of the Maintenance Management Improvement
    Plan (MMIP), should serve as input to developing work packages. Additionally,
    it is required that in FEM the Work Order:

    (i) description should mirror the work package and associated Work Category Code
    descriptions and be preceded by "FY19 SWA". If a work package was created in FEM
    in previous years, was not funded, and will be resubmitted for FY19, the Work
    Order description may be updated as necessary.

    (ii) the FEM work order long description field should contain exactly the same
    Information as the budget work package description and the associated Work Category
    Code.

    (iii) type should be "SWA," Specific Work Activity.

    (iv) the Command Work Type should be Deferred Maintenance (DM).'

- label: FUSRAP
  altName: [Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program]
  definition: The FUSRAP program is to protect human health and the environment from
    residual radioactive contamination at sites formerly utilized by the Manhattan
    Engineer District for the Nation's early atomic energy program. The major objectives
    of the FUSRAP program are to evaluate and remediate, as necessary, sites identified
    by the Department of Energy - Office of Legacy Management (DOE-LM) as eligible
    for consideration under FUSRAP.
  anchor: '15'
- label: General Reevaluation Study
  altName: [ GRR ]
  definition: This is a study that involves reformulation of alternatives from a previously
    completed Feasibility Study. The addition of separable element(s) or separable
    implementable features may be included in a General Reevaluation Study so long
    as reformulation of the already- recommended or already-authorized alternative
    is included. The phase activity code is GR.
  anchor: '274'
- label: Inactive Facility
  definition: "A facility that does not have a specific current or near-term program\
    \ or mission requirement is considered \"Inactive\". Inactive facilities or parts\
    \ of facilities are assets not currently needed to support the agency's mission\
    \ or function but will have a planned need in the future. Inactive facilities\
    \ may be classified by status: Standby or Mothball, corresponding to the Federal\
    \ Real Property Council Indicator status inactive. The following conditions\
    \ characterize all inactive facilities or parts of facilities that are inactive:\
    \ No personnel occupy the facility.\n2. Utilities are curtailed, other than as\
    \ required for fire prevention, security, or safety. 3. The facility is secured\
    \ to prevent unauthorized access and injury to personnel.\n4. The facility does\
    \ not receive funding for renewal or other significant improvement."
  anchor: '274'
- label: Level of Performance
  altName: [ LOP ]
  definition: "LoP is a management decision in the context of the available maintenance
    resources, maintenance demands of an asset, and asset service demands or capacity.
    If formally established, the asset''s formally determined Level of Service (LoS),
    may be used in considering asset demand/capacity. Managers should understand the
    minimum funding levels necessary to meet regulatory and safety requirements as
    caretaker of the facility/asset. Beyond this, a range of facility performance
    levels are available. In the budget context, LoP's may be broadly grouped No
    Mission (Red), Partial Mission (Yellow), Full Mission (Green). Managers must understand
    the range of performance available for the facility and the associated investments
    required to achieve various performance levels. Work packages are formulated to
    express the investment necessary to achieve a given performance level for the
    facility/asset. Further definition of the three LOPs: No Mission LOP is funding
    required to simply own a project; Partial Mission represents the additional funding
    required to deliver the majority of project benefits, but not meet all requirements;
    and Full Mission includes the additional funding required to deliver all project
    benefits and fully preserve the facility for the foreseeable future."
  anchor: '275'
- label: Limited Reevaluation Study
  altName: [ LRR ]
  definition: This is a reexamination of project justification, including the economics
    and/or environmental effects, which does not require reformulation of project
    alternatives for an ongoing study. No longer used, See Validation Studies and
    Annex I.
  anchor: '275'
- label: Lowest Sustainable Investment
  definition: The lowest overall investment level that a prudent manager would select,
    balancing between short and long term economics and considering overall availability
    of resources. Sustainability in this sense is crucial to ensure that project meets
    or exceeds project life-cycle expectations including meeting or exceeding changing
    environmental requirements for compliant operation.
  anchor: '275'
- label: Maintenance
  definition: "Work to restore equipment, assets, facilities or components to design\
    \ conditions or to conditions that have been determined to be sufficient to meet\
    \ a prescribed level of performance (vice \"activities directed toward keeping\
    \ assets in an acceptable condition\"); replacement of parts, systems, or components;\
    \ preventive maintenance and inspection/monitoring of facilities or equipment\
    \ (excluding formal inspection/monitoring of facilities or equipment required\
    \ by USACE guidance such as ER 1110-2- 1156, ER 1110-2-111, and others); and other\
    \ activities needed to preserve or maintain the asset. Maintenance and repairs,\
    \ as distinguished from capital improvements, exclude activities directed towards\
    \ expanding the capacity of an asset or otherwise upgrading it to serve needs\
    \ different from, or significantly greater than, its current use. (SFFAS\
    \ 40 & 6 maintenance on plant, property, and equipment (PP&E)) This activity involves\
    \ \"maintenance\" as well as \"operation\" staff. However, Common O&M and Specific\
    \ Work Activity maintenance or rehabilitations are maintenance so long as the\
    \ action does not expand the capacity, or alter use."
  anchor: '276'
- label: Major Maintenance
  definition: Major maintenance is defined as a non-repetitive item of work or aggregate
    items of related work for which the total estimated cost exceeds $6,200,000, and
    which does not qualify as Major Rehabilitation. This designation is not applicable
    to dredging, but it is applicable to dredged material disposal facilities. The
    related items of work should include all items required to make the work effective
    for its desired purpose. Optional or casually-related work which is not essential
    to the major maintenance item should be programmed, prioritized, and justified
    as a separate work package, or part of another work package, as appropriate. Major
    Maintenance work packages are budgeted under the O&M account only.
  anchor: '275'
- label: Major Rehabilitation
  definition: "Rehabilitation projects are projects to restore or ensure continuation\
    \ of project functions or outputs. Section 205 of P.L.102-580 defines rehabilitation\
    \ with respect to inland waterway projects, as either:\n1. Economically justified\
    \ structural work for restoration of a major project feature that extends the\
    \ life of the feature significantly and will take at least 2 years to complete,\
    \ and has a capital cost of at least $8,000,000, adjusted for changes in price\
    \ levels (reliability improvements). The updated threshold for (a) is $ 21 million.\n\
    2. Structural modifications that enhance operational efficiency and that have\
    \ a capital cost of at least $1,000,000, adjusted for changes in price levels\
    \ (efficiency improvements). Section 205 of P.L. 102-580 (WRDA 1992) was amended\
    \ by Section 2006 of P.L. 113-121, WRRDA 2014, which increased the major rehabilitation\
    \ threshold from $8,000,000 to $20,000,000. The updated threshold for 1. is 21.5\
    \ million and for 2. is 2.1 million. By policy these thresholds also apply to\
    \ all Business Lines / Missions."

- label: Mothball status
  altName: [long term inactive]
  definition: "An asset status applied to facilities when a decision has been made\
    \ to suspend operations for an extended period of time and for which maintenance\
    \ measures have been taken to prevent deterioration of essential systems. Mothballing\
    \ generally results in higher first-year costs, but future annual costs are lower\
    \ due to reduced maintenance and repair requirements. Mothball status is distinct\
    \ from caretaker or standby status; corresponds to the Federal\
    \ Real Property Indicator status inactive. Mothball status is defined\
    \ at the project or project site level, not the feature level. The total time\
    \ to deactivate and then to reactivate a facility, including the mothballed period,\
    \ generally exceeds 36 months. In addition to the conditions indicated above,\
    \ the following conditions characterize mothballed facilities:\n1. Utility systems\
    \ and collateral equipment have been properly prepared for long-term inactivation\
    \ without significant deterioration. Selected systems, such as cathodic and fire\
    \ detection systems are kept in operation and routinely inspected.\n2. The facility\
    \ interior is equipped with appropriate environmental control to prevent significant\
    \ deterioration.\n3. Hazardous materials have been removed.\n4. The facility exterior\
    \ envelope is inspected routinely and the integrity and appearance of the exterior\
    \ shell are maintained.\n5. Personal property is reported to the USACE Logistic\
    \ Agency for reutilization."

    basis, with a frequency of greater than one year and less than seven to ten years.
    Examples are channel dredging, painting, floor coverings, engine overhauls, etc.
    These generally fall below Capital thresholds. These are also the items that are
    frequently deferred. Recurring Maintenance is also referred to as Cyclical Maintenance.

- label: Rehabilitation
  definition: A budget category for Specific Work Activities which exceed cost thresholds
    of Section 205 of P.L. 102-580 (WRDA 1992) as amended by Section 2006 of P.L.
    113-121, WRRDA 2014.

- label: Remaining Benefits Remaining Cost Ratio
  altName: [ RBRCR ]
  definition: "Compute the RBRCR at the applicable interest rate, the current interest
    rate, and the OMB prescribed 7% interest rate for projects and separable elements
    other than design or construction deficiency correction projects, safety of dams
    projects, and aquatic ecosystem restoration projects.

    (1) Remaining Costs. Consider anticipated Federal and non-Federal allocations
    and other non- Federal costs through the BY-1 as sunk, and exclude them from the
    RBRCR computation. The remaining costs will be the Federal and non-Federal allocations
    as of the end of BY-1 based on the current project cost estimate and allocations
    from prior years and on the President's Budget for BY-2 in October 2017 dollars.
    Where the project includes completed separable elements, independent units and/or
    useful increments, OMRR&R costs for completed units/increments will also be considered
    sunk, and only OMRR&R for remaining units/increments will be considered in remaining
    project costs. The remaining costs should include any reimbursements still needing
    to be paid for work already completed.

    (2) Remaining Benefits. Where the project includes completed separable elements,
    independent units and/or useful increments, the amount of annual benefits that
    would be expected to accrue over the period of analysis for completed or functioning
    components of the total project will be considered sunk and excluded from the
    RBRCR computation. Sunk benefits for projects that have reimbursable features
    should be estimated based on the reimbursable costs expended and an estimate on
    the amount of sunk benefits that would be associated with that level of expenditure.
    Remaining benefits are those that will be attainable in the BY or thereafter only
    if project features not completed with allocations through BY-1 are completed
    and operated and maintained."

- label: Resumption- Construction
  altName: [ Construction ]
  definition: A construction resumption is renewal of physical construction activities
    on a project or separable element on which physical construction under a construction
    contract has not been performed in any of the three most recent fiscal years before
    the fiscal year in question. However, in the case of a construction project with
    intermittent construction activities, such as phases, levee lifts, or renourishment
    cycles, initiation of the next intermittent construction activity is not a resumption.

- label: Resumption- Study
  altName: [ Investigation ]
  definition: A study resumption is the renewal of study activities on a study that
    has not been funded in any of the three most recent fiscal years before the fiscal
    year in question.

- label: Smart Use of Systems
  definition: The objective of the Smart Use of Systems is to make efficient and consistent
    use of the various tools currently being used within the Corps of Engineers Civil
    Works program for project and program data. CWIF-D is the tool that will be used
    to collect project/program data from the various other data sources within the
    Corps and then provide an intuitive and user friendly platform for users to enter
    and manage the project and program data needed for budget and work plan development.
  anchor: '279'
- label: Specific Work Activities
  definition: "Typically includes scoping, cost estimates, Project Management Plans\
    \ and/or contract actions, and larger scale planned operations or planned component\
    \ renewals related efforts such as unique operation and maintenance actions with\
    \ a specific beginning and end that require a greater level of rigor and documentation.\
    \ Each Specific Work Activity must be shown separately to allow for individual\
    \ funding decisions based on performance metrics and risk-based indices. The entire\
    \ cost for all project-specific marine construction work or fleet work, including\
    \ dredging and revetment work, whether by contract or hired labor, must be visible\
    \ in this category, along with full Recurring (cyclical) and Component Renewal\
    \ maintenance requirements to support anticipated mission delivery or to meet\
    \ anticipated levels of service in subsequent budget years, including major\
    \ maintenance level packages. Recapitalization (including betterments) actions\
    \ including rehabilitation, Major Maintenance and Major Rehabilitations studies\
    \ or evaluations should be requested as Specific Work Activities. Also, estimated\
    \ corrective maintenance (proactive) resourcing for commonly occurring breakdown\
    \ maintenance should be requested as Specific Work Activities. It is a budget\
    \ category for unique operation and maintenance actions with a specific beginning\
    \ and end, which require a greater level of rigor and documentation in the form\
    \ of planning, scoping, contracting, etc. Each Specific Work Activity must be\
    \ shown separately to allow for individual funding decisions based on performance\
    \ metrics and risk-based indices."

- label: Spin-off Studies
  altName: [ SS ]
  definition: A Feasibility Study that is specifically identified in a final report
    from a Comprehensive or Basin-wide Study and that would be carried out under the
    same study authority as the Comprehensive or Basin-wide, if provided for by that
    authority, is termed a Spin-off Study.
  anchor: '279'
- label: Systems
  definition: "Is an area with a common function, such as a coastal system, navigation\
    \ system or ecosystem. A system boundary is not a true drainage boundary, but\
    \ does have hydrological function considerations. The term watershed\
    \ will be used throughout this budget EC, and will refer to both watersheds and\
    \ coastal systems."

- label: Systems-Based Budgeting
  altName: [ SBB ]
  definition: (SBB) explicitly acknowledges that the projects and work packages included
    in each year's budget submission are interconnected, within the context of systems
    and watersheds in which they operate. As such, the decision to fund (or not to
    fund) any given project or work package influences both the stand-alone project
    and system as a whole. Systems-based budgeting accounts for the interconnected
    performance of projects within watersheds and systems, in order to provide decision
    makers with a more clearly articulated description of work packages and project
    Value to Nation.
  anchor: '279'
- label: Validation Study
  altName: [ VS ]
  definition: This is a reexamination of project justification, including the economics
    and/or environmental effects that does not require reformulation of alternatives.
    A Validation Study may be carried out using any funds appropriated for the project
    and the cost of the Validation Study is shared under the applicable Design Agreement
    or Project Partnership Agreement.
