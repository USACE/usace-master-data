                    <p>Administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Flood Insurance Program is a voluntary program authorized by Congress to mitigate flood losses through community-enforced building and zoning ordinances and to provide property owners with access to federally-backed flood insurance. As part of the National Flood Insurance Program, the Federal Emergency Management Agency issues Flood Insurance Rate Maps that depict flood hazards and are used by local communities for the purposes of determining flood insurance and floodplain management requirements. The National Flood Insurance Program requires federally regulated lending institutions to ensure that mortgage loans secured for buildings in high flood hazard areas, referred to as Special Flood Hazard Areas, are covered by flood insurance.</p>
