        parentTopic: Compensatory Mitigation for Losses of Aquatic Resources
terms:
- label: Adaptive management
  definition: 'means the development of a management strategy that anticipates likely
    challenges associated with compensatory mitigation projects and provides for the
    implementation of actions to address those challenges, as well as unforeseen changes
    to those projects. It requires consideration of the risk, uncertainty, and dynamic
    nature of compensatory mitigation projects and guides modification of those projects
    to optimize performance. It includes the selection of appropriate measures that
    will ensure that the aquatic resource functions are provided and involves analysis
    of monitoring results to identify potential problems of a compensatory mitigation
    project and the identification and implementation of measures to rectify those
    problems.'
- label: Advance credits
  definition: 'means any credits of an approved in-lieu fee program that are available
    for sale prior to being fulfilled in accordance with an approved mitigation project
    plan. Advance credit sales require an approved in-lieu fee program instrument
    that meets all applicable requirements including a specific allocation of advance
    credits, by service area where applicable. The instrument must also contain a
    schedule for fulfillment of advance credit sales.'
- label: Buffer
  definition: 'means an upland, wetland, and/or riparian area that protects and/or
    enhances aquatic resource functions associated with wetlands, rivers, streams,
    lakes, marine, and estuarine systems from disturbances associated with adjacent
    land uses.'
- label: Compensatory mitigation
  definition: means the restoration (re-establishment or rehabilitation), establishment
    (creation), enhancement, and/or in certain circumstances preservation of aquatic
    resources for the purposes of offsetting unavoidable adverse impacts which remain
    after all appropriate and practicable avoidance and minimization has been achieved.
- label: Compensatory mitigation project
  definition: means compensatory mitigation implemented by the permittee as a requirement
    of a DA permit (i.e., permittee-responsible mitigation), or by a mitigation bank
    or an in-lieu fee program.
- label: Condition
  definition: means the relative ability of an aquatic resource to support and maintain
    a community of organisms having a species composition, diversity, and functional
    organization comparable to reference aquatic resources in the region.
- label: Credit
  definition: means a unit of measure (e.g., a functional or areal measure or other
    suitable metric) representing the accrual or attainment of aquatic functions at
    a compensatory mitigation site. The measure of aquatic functions is based on the
    resources restored, established, enhanced, or preserved.
- label: Days
  definition: Calendar days
- label: Debit
  definition: means a unit of measure (e.g., a functional or areal measure or other
    suitable metric) representing the loss of aquatic functions at an impact or project
    site. The measure of aquatic functions is based on the resources impacted by the
    authorized activity.
- label: Enhancement
  definition: means the manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics
    of an aquatic resource to heighten, intensify, or improve a specific aquatic resource
    function(s). Enhancement results in the gain of selected aquatic resource function(s),
    but may also lead to a decline in other aquatic resource function(s). Enhancement
    does not result in a gain in aquatic resource area.
- label: Establishment
  definition: (creation) means the manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological
    characteristics present to develop an aquatic resource that did not previously
    exist at an upland site. Establishment results in a gain in aquatic resource area
    and functions.
- label: Fulfillment of advance credit sales of an in-lieu fee program
  definition: means application of credits released in accordance with a credit release
    schedule in an approved mitigation project plan to satisfy the mitigation requirements
    represented by the advance credits. Only after any advance credit sales within
    a service area have been fulfilled through the application of released credits
    from an in-lieu fee project (in accordance with the credit release schedule for
    an approved mitigation project plan), may additional released credits from that
    project be sold or transferred to permittees. When advance credits are fulfilled,
    an equal number of new advance credits is restored to the program sponsor for
    sale or transfer to permit applicants.
- label: Functional capacity
  definition: means the degree to which an area of aquatic resource performs a specific
    function.
- label: Functions
  definition: means the physical, chemical, and biological processes that occur in
    ecosystems.
- label: Impact
  definition: means adverse effect.
- label: In-kind
  definition: means a resource of a similar structural and functional type to the
    impacted resource.
- label: In-lieu fee program
  definition: means a program involving the restoration, establishment, enhancement,
    and/or preservation of aquatic resources through funds paid to a governmental
    or non-profit natural resources management entity to satisfy compensatory mitigation
    requirements for DA permits. Similar to a mitigation bank, an in-lieu fee program
    sells compensatory mitigation credits to permittees whose obligation to provide
    compensatory mitigation is then transferred to the in-lieu program sponsor. However,
    the rules governing the operation and use of in-lieu fee programs are somewhat
    different from the rules governing operation and use of mitigation banks. The
    operation and use of an in-lieu fee program are governed by an in-lieu fee program
    instrument.
- label: In-lieu fee program instrument
  definition: means the legal document for the establishment, operation, and use of
    an in-lieu fee program.
- label: Instrument
  definition: means mitigation banking instrument or in-lieu fee program instrument.
- label: Interagency Review Team
  altName: [ IRT ]
  definition: (IRT) means an interagency group of federal, tribal, state, and/or local
    regulatory and resource agency representatives that reviews documentation for,
    and advises the district engineer on, the establishment and management of a mitigation
    bank or an in-lieu fee program.
- label: Mitigation bank
  definition: means a site, or suite of sites, where resources (e.g., wetlands, streams,
    riparian areas) are restored, established, enhanced, and/or preserved for the
    purpose of providing compensatory mitigation for impacts authorized by DA permits.
    In general, a mitigation bank sells compensatory mitigation credits to permittees
    whose obligation to provide compensatory mitigation is then transferred to the
    mitigation bank sponsor. The operation and use of a mitigation bank are governed
    by a mitigation banking instrument.
- label: Mitigation banking instrument
  definition: means the legal document for the establishment, operation, and use of
    a mitigation bank.
- label: Off-site
  definition: means an area that is neither located on the same parcel of land as
    the impact site, nor on a parcel of land contiguous to the parcel containing the
    impact site.
- label: On-site
  definition: means an area located on the same parcel of land as the impact site,
    or on a parcel of land contiguous to the impact site.
- label: Out-of-kind
  definition: means a resource of a different structural and functional type from
    the impacted resource.
- label: Performance standards
  definition: are observable or measurable physical (including hydrological), chemical
    and/or biological attributes that are used to determine if a compensatory mitigation
    project meets its objectives.
- label: Permittee-responsible mitigation
  definition: means an aquatic resource restoration, establishment, enhancement, and/or
    preservation activity undertaken by the permittee (or an authorized agent or contractor)
    to provide compensatory mitigation for which the permittee retains full responsibility.
- label: Preservation
  definition: means the removal of a threat to, or preventing the decline of, aquatic
    resources by an action in or near those aquatic resources. This term includes
    activities commonly associated with the protection and maintenance of aquatic
    resources through the implementation of appropriate legal and physical mechanisms.
    Preservation does not result in a gain of aquatic resource area or functions.
- label: Re-establishment
  definition: means the manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics
    of a site with the goal of returning natural/historic functions to a former aquatic
    resource. Re-establishment results in rebuilding a former aquatic resource and
    results in a gain in aquatic resource area and functions.
- label: Reference aquatic resources
  definition: are a set of aquatic resources that represent the full range of variability
    exhibited by a regional class of aquatic resources as a result of natural processes
    and anthropogenic disturbances.
- label: Rehabilitation
  definition: means the manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics
    of a site with the goal of repairing natural/historic functions to a degraded
    aquatic resource. Rehabilitation results in a gain in aquatic resource function,
    but does not result in a gain in aquatic resource area.
- label: Release of credits
  definition: means a determination by the district engineer, in consultation with
    the IRT, that credits associated with an approved mitigation plan are available
    for sale or transfer, or in the case of an in-lieu fee program, for fulfillment
    of advance credit sales. A proportion of projected credits for a specific mitigation
    bank or in-lieu fee project may be released upon approval of the mitigation plan,
    with additional credits released as milestones specified in the credit release
    schedule are achieved.
- label: Restoration
  definition: 'means the manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics
    of a site with the goal of returning natural/historic functions to a former or
    degraded aquatic resource. For the purpose of tracking net gains in aquatic resource
    area, restoration is divided into two categories: re-establishment and rehabilitation.'
- label: Riparian areas
  definition: are lands adjacent to streams, rivers, lakes, and estuarine-marine shorelines.
    Riparian areas provide a variety of ecological functions and services and help
    improve or maintain local water quality.
- label: Service area
  definition: means the geographic area within which impacts can be mitigated at a
    specific mitigation bank or an in-lieu fee program, as designated in its instrument.
- label: Services
  definition: mean the benefits that human populations receive from functions that
    occur in ecosystems.
- label: Sponsor
  definition: means any public or private entity responsible for establishing, and
    in most circumstances, operating a mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program.
- label: Standard permit
  definition: means a standard, individual permit issued under the authority of section
    404 of the Clean Water Act and/or sections 9 or 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act
    of 1899.
- label: Temporal loss
  definition: is the time lag between the loss of aquatic resource functions caused
    by the permitted impacts and the replacement of aquatic resource functions at
    the compensatory mitigation site. Higher compensation ratios may be required to
    compensate for temporal loss. When the compensatory mitigation project is initiated
    prior to, or concurrent with, the permitted impacts, the district engineer may
    determine that compensation for temporal loss is not necessary, unless the resource
    has a long development time.
- label: Watershed
  definition: means a land area that drains to a common waterway, such as a stream,
    lake, estuary, wetland, or ultimately the ocean.
- label: Watershed approach
  definition: means an analytical process for making compensatory mitigation decisions
    that support the sustainability or improvement of aquatic resources in a watershed.
    It involves consideration of watershed needs, and how locations and types of compensatory
    mitigation projects address those needs. A landscape perspective is used to identify
    the types and locations of compensatory mitigation projects that will benefit
    the watershed and offset losses of aquatic resource functions and services caused
    by activities authorized by DA permits. The watershed approach may involve consideration
    of landscape scale, historic and potential aquatic resource conditions, past and
    projected aquatic resource impacts in the watershed, and terrestrial connections
    between aquatic resources when determining compensatory mitigation requirements
    for DA permits.
- label: Watershed plan
  definition: means a plan developed by federal, tribal, state, and/or local government
    agencies or appropriate non-governmental organizations, in consultation with relevant
    stakeholders, for the specific goal of aquatic resource restoration, establishment,
    enhancement, and preservation. A watershed plan addresses aquatic resource conditions
    in the watershed, multiple stakeholder interests, and land uses. Watershed plans
    may also identify priority sites for aquatic resource restoration and protection.
    Examples of watershed plans include special area management plans, advance identification
    programs, and wetland management plans.
