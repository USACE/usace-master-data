An allowable deviations is a risk-informed and temporary operation consistent with the project authorization, all other applicable laws and policies, and the objectives for system and project operations. A deviation may be made in order to respond to unforeseen circumstances, alleviate temporary problems or realize opportunities to increase project benefits (both direct and incidental) on a temporary basis.</p>

                    <h2>Drought</h2>
                    <p>A deficiency of moisture or lack of storage that results in adverse impacts on people, animals, or vegetation over a sizeable area. Determination of drought conditions, in relation to the conditions of streamflow, is usually based on the most critically severe sequence of lowwater conditions as determined from the historical period of record of streamflow for a particular
river system. Inasmuch as the period of record of streamflow data varies widely between river
systems, this criterion does not yield a consistent measure of drought severity. Hydrologic lowflow analysis utilizing historical data may be necessary to yield consistent probabilities of lowwater sequences. </p>
