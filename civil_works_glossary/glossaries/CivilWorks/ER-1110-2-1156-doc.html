Any such barrier which is under six feet in height regardless of storage capacity, or which has a storage capacity at maximum water storage elevation not in excess of fifteen acre-feet regardless of height is not considered a dam. This lower size limitation should be waived if there is a potentially significant downstream hazard. This definition applies whether the dam has a permanent reservoir or is a detention dam for temporary storage of floodwaters. The impounding capacity at maximum water storage elevation includes storage of floodwaters above the normal full storage elevation. Various types of dams include the following: a. Afterbay dam. See regulating dam.; b. Ambursen dam. A buttress dam in which the upstream part is a relatively thin flat slab usually made of reinforced concrete.; c. Arch dam. A concrete or masonry dam, which is curved upstream so as to transmit the major part of the water load to the abutments. d. Buttress dam. A dam consisting of a watertight part supported at intervals on the downstream side by a series of buttresses. A buttress dam can take many forms, such as a flat slab or a massive head buttress. e. Cofferdam. A temporary structure enclosing all or part of the construction area so that construction can proceed in the dry. A diversion cofferdam diverts a stream into a pipe, channel, tunnel, or other watercourse. f. Crib dam. A gravity dam built up of boxes, crossed timbers, or gabions filled with earth or rock. g. Diversion dam. A dam built to divert water from a waterway or stream into a different watercourse. h. Double curvature arch dam. An arch dam, which is curved vertically as well as horizontally. i. Earth dam. An embankment dam in which more than 50 percent of the total volume is formed of compacted earth material generally smaller than 3-inch size. j. Embankment dam. Any dam constructed of excavated natural materials or of industrial waste materials. k. Gravity dam. A dam constructed of concrete and/or masonry, which relies on its weight and internal strength for stability. l. Hollow gravity dam. A dam constructed of concrete and/or masonry on the outside but having a hollow interior and relying on its weight for stability. m. Hydraulic fill dam. An earth dam constructed of materials, often dredged, which are conveyed and placed by suspension in flowing water. n. Industrial waste dam. An embankment dam, usually built in stages, to create storage for the disposal of waste products from an industrial process. The waste products are conveyed as fine material suspended in water to the reservoir impounded by the embankment. The embankment may be built of conventional materials but sometimes incorporates suitable waste products. o. Masonry dam. Any dam constructed mainly of stone, brick, or concrete blocks jointed with mortar. A dam having only a masonry facing should not be referred to as a masonry dam. p. Mine tailings dam. An industrial waste dam in which the waste materials come from mining operations or mineral processing. q. Multiple arch dam. A buttress dam composed of a series of arches for the upstream face. r. Overflow dam. A dam designed to be overtopped. s. Regulating dam. A dam impounding a reservoir from which water is released to regulate the flow downstream. t. Rockfill dam. An embankment dam in which more than 50 percent of the total volume is composed of compacted or dumped cobbles, boulders, rock fragments, or quarried rock generally larger than 3-inch size. u. Roller-compacted concrete dam. A concrete gravity dam constructed by the use of a dry mix concrete transported by conventional construction equipment and compacted by rolling, usually with vibratory rollers. v. Rubble dam. A stone masonry dam in which the stones are unshaped or uncoursed. w. Saddle dam (or dike). A subsidiary dam of any type constructed across a saddle or low point on the perimeter of a reservoir. x. Tailings dam. See mine tailings dam.</p>

It requires the collective application of engineering principles and experience, and a philosophy of risk management that recognizes that a dam is a structure whose safe functioning is not explicitly determined by its original design and construction. It also includes all actions taken to routinely monitor, evaluate, identify or predict dam safety issues and consequences related to failure including ensuring all reservoir regulation activities are performed in accordance with established water control plans in support of dam safety concerns. These actions are to be performed in concert with activities to document, publicize, and reduce, eliminate, or remediate, to the extent reasonably practicable, any unacceptable risks.</p>

                    <p>The Dam Safety Action Classification system is intended to provide consistent and systematic guidelines for appropriate actions to address the dam safety issues and deficiencies of USACE dams. USACE dams are assigned a DSAC class informed by their incremental flood risk considered as a combination of probability of failure and potential life safety, economic, environmental, or other consequences. The DSAC table presents different levels and urgencies of actions that are commensurate with the different levels of incremental flood risk associated with USACE dams. These actions range from immediate recognition of a very high urgency requiring extraordinary and immediate action for dams considered critically near failure or dams with very high incremental flood risk through normal level of urgency for the operations and dam safety activities for dams with very low incremental flood risk and that meet all essential USACE guideline.</p>

However, the level of detail should only be what is needed to justify the modification decision. Related NEPA (reference A.6) and ESA (reference A.10) studies will be conducted during the Modification Study, in support of the recommended risk reduction measures. The resultant Dam Safety Modification Decision Document will present a comparison of alternatives and the recommended risk management plan to include actions, components, risk reduction by increments or stages, implementation plan, detailed cost estimate, NEPA, and ESA determinations.</p>

                    <p>The management process shown generally on Figure 2.3 and for USACE in detail on Figure 3.1. It is a risk-informed USACE-wide portfolio perspective process applied to all features of all dams on a continuing basis. Dam Safety Program “ The purposes of a dam safety program are to protect life, property, and the environment by ensuring that all dams are designed, constructed, operated, and maintained as safely and effectively as is reasonably possible. Accomplishing these purposes require commitments to continually inspect, evaluate, and document the design, construction, operations, maintenance, rehabilitation, and emergency preparedness of each dam and the associated public. It also requires the archiving of documents on the inspections and history of dams and the training of personnel who inspect, evaluate, operate, and maintain them. Programs must instill an awareness of dams and the potential hazard that they may present in the owners, the users, the public, and the local and national decision-makers. On both local and national scales, program purposes also include periodic reporting on the degree of program implementation. Key to accomplishing these purposes is to attract, train, and retain a staff proficient in the art and science of dam design.</p>

                    <p>Condition when the costs of making a wrong decision are deemed to be high. The basic concept of regret is the difference between the outcome of the &#34;best alternative for a future, uncertain state&#34; and outcome of each alternative evaluated for that state. So it is really the potential costs, if you choose an alternative as the best given some future scenario, and a different future actually happens. All regret values are determined by comparing each alternative to the best (e.g. maximum net benefits) for a scenario. So you end up with a regret matrix with scenarios as column headings and alternatives as row headings. There is nothing in the notion about regret about it being &#34;too high.&#34; The minimax principle is usually applied to regret to identify the plan or plans that are robust across multiple future scenarios.</p>

                    <p>An event tree serves as a model of the physical dam system in which each node represents an identifiable behavior of the dam or its physical components and each event should be something that happens in space or time (Hartford and Baecher, 2004). An event tree begins with a single initiating branch on the left hand side and progress toward more detailed events to the right hand side. Starting with an initiating event branch (e.g. a severe flood, an earthquake or other natural or human caused hazards), each node is divided at various nodes to generate all possible subsequent events. Each node is an origin of possible subsequent events and each branch is a possible event that is a logical consequence of the one before it, and a necessary precursor of the one that follows. As the number of events increases, structure fans outs like the branches of a tree until each event tree chain comes to a terminal branch. Terminal branches are the system outcome or system effect of an initiating event which leads to adverse consequences or failure of the system completely or partially.

The system may be used to measure settlement during embankment construction (Bartholomew, Murray, and Goins 1987). A reference benchmark is used to establish the top of the inclinometer casing. The instrument probe is lowered to each slip joint in the casing, and the depth to each joint is read directly off the tape.

                    <h2>Lead Engineer</h2>
                    <p>A registered professional engineer (typically a civil, geotechnical, or structural engineer) or engineering geologist qualified through appropriate technical training and experience, assigned the responsibility to lead the technical team members of a product delivery team. The engineering geologist is required to be a registered professional engineer. The lead engineer is responsible for working closely with the Project Manager and insuring that all technical requirements are addressed in the Project Management Plan (PMP). The lead engineer insure that the necessary field investigations are completed during the study and design phases; that plans and specifications are reviewed; that the technical comments on the design are properly addressed; and that engineers on the PDT visit the project during the construction phase. When possible the same individual should function as the lead engineer from the start of the studies until the completion of the project.

                    <p>The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (reference A.6) requires federal agencies to integrate environmental values into their decision making processes by considering the environmental impacts of their proposed actions and reasonable alternatives to those actions. To meet NEPA requirements federal agencies prepare a detailed statement known as an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). EPA reviews and comments on EIS&#39;s prepared by other federal agencies, maintains a national filing system for all EIS&#39;s, and assures that its own actions comply with NEPA.</p>

                    <p>The probability of individual life loss, which is used in the evaluation of Individual incremental life safety risk, is not necessarily the same as the probability of failure that is used in the evaluation of Reclamation&#39;s APF guideline. The probability of life loss is based on the probability of failure and a consideration of exposure factors such as day-night differences in PAR and evaluation and the seasonal presence of people in campgrounds. The level of detail that is appropriate for characterizing exposure factors should be decision driven, although it is noted that FEMA&#39;s HAZUS data base provides opportunity for some level of automation in capturing information on exposure factors. The distinction between probability of failure and probability of life loss is particularly important for navigation dams, but can also have a significant effect on the evaluation of life safety for other types of dams. It applies to societal risk as well as to individual risk.</p>

A risk assessment is a systematic, evidence based approach for quantifying and describing the nature, likelihood, and magnitude of risk associated with the current condition and the same values resulting from a changed condition due to some action. Risk assessment includes explicit acknowledgment of the uncertainties in the risk. As applied to dam safety, the process of identifying the likelihood and consequences of dam failure to provide the basis for informed decisions on a course of action.</p>

Such large risks are typically unevenly distributed, as are their attendant benefits. Thus the construction of a dam represents a risk to those close by and a benefit to those further off, or a process may harm some future generation more than the present one. The distribution and balancing of such major costs and benefits is a classic function of Government, subject to public discussion and discussion (HSE, 1995 reference A.144) and (ANCOLD October 2003) (reference A.130).</p>
