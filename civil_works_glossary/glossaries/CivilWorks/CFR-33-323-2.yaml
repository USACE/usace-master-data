    \ States; \n(ii) The runoff or overflow from a contained land or water disposal\

    \ ditching, channelization, or other excavation. \nThe term discharge of dredged\
    \ material does not include the following: \n(i) Discharges of pollutants into\
    \ waters of the United States resulting from the onshore subsequent processing\
    \ of dredged material that is extracted for any commercial use (other than fill).\
    \ These discharges are subject to section 402 of the Clean Water Act even though\
    \ the extraction and deposit of such material may require a permit from the Corps\
    \ or applicable State section 404 program. \n(ii) Activities that involve only\
    \ the cutting or removing of vegetation above the ground (e.g., mowing, rotary\
    \ cutting, and chainsawing) where the activity neither substantially disturbs\
