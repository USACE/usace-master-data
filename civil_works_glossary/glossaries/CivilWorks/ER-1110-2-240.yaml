terms:
- label: Storage
  definition: The retention of water or delay of runoff either by planned operation,
    as in a reservoir, or by temporary filling of overflow areas, as in the progression
    of a flood wave through a natural stream channel.

- label: Deviation
  definition: An operation that departs from the approved water control plan or manual
    or operations prescribed by the approved water control plans or manual constitutes
    a deviation. This could include a planned, unplanned, or emergency deviation.
    An allowable deviations is a risk-informed and temporary operation consistent
    with the project authorization, all other applicable laws and policies, and the
    objectives for system and project operations. A deviation may be made in order
    to respond to unforeseen circumstances, alleviate temporary problems or realize
    opportunities to increase project benefits (both direct and incidental) on a temporary
    basis.

- label: Drought
  definition: 'A deficiency of moisture or lack of storage that results in adverse
    impacts on people, animals, or vegetation over a sizeable area. Determination
    of drought conditions, in relation to the conditions of streamflow, is usually
    based on the most critically severe sequence of lowwater conditions as determined
    from the historical period of record of streamflow for a particular

    river system. Inasmuch as the period of record of streamflow data varies widely
    between river

    systems, this criterion does not yield a consistent measure of drought severity.
    Hydrologic lowflow analysis utilizing historical data may be necessary to yield
    consistent probabilities of lowwater sequences.

  definition: "As used herein, a statement that consummates this regulation for any\
    \ given project and defines the general provisions or conditions of the local\
    \ sponsor or owner, cooperation agreed to in the authorizing legislative document,\
    \ and the requirements for compliance with Section 7 of the Flood Control Act\
    \ of 1944, the Federal Power Act, or other special act of Congress. The letter\
    \ of understanding will be signed by a duly authorized representative of the Chief\
    \ of Engineers and the project owner. A field working agreement may be\
    \ substituted for a letter of understanding, provided that the specified minimum\
    \ requirements of the latter, as stated above, are met."

- label: Master Water Control Manual
  definition: A water control manual prepared for a system of projects rather than
    an individual project. Operation. The physical manipulation of spillway gates,
    outlet works, or instrumentation associated with projects. Operations prescribed
    by a water control plan shall include the operational flexibility necessary to
    accomplish the authorized purposes of the project under foreseeable conditions,
    according to the approved water control plan or manual. The approved water control
    plan or manual is a result of intensive study and includes the hydrologic, hydraulic,
    and reservoir regulation analyses of the historical period of record. These analyses
    cover a wide range of hydrologic conditions. The water control plan which could
    include guide curves, physical constraints, and operational constraints is tested
    against this range of conditions. The resulting simulated operations depict what
    could be represented as normal, high or low flows and a range of operations to
    respond to those conditions. Operations within the range contemplated or prescribed
    by a water control plan reflect the operational flexibility of the water control
    plan or manual and are not considered deviations.

    projects

- label: Real Time
  definition: 'As used herein, real time denotes the processing of current information
    or data in a sufficiently timely manner to influence a physical response in the
    system being monitored or controlled. The term includes information on the analyses
    for and execution of water control decisions for both minor and major flood events
    and for navigation and low water regulation based on prevailing hydro-meteorological
    and other conditions and constraints, to achieve

    efficient management of water resource systems.'

- label: Reservoir
  definition: "Any dam-and-reservoir project surveyed, planned, and constructed, or\
    \ to be planned, surveyed, constructed, and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of\
    \ Engineers, that is intended to contain storage to be jointly managed and operated\
    \ for multiple purposes under federal law. The terms reservoir and project\
    \ may comprise a single dam-and-reservoir facility or a system of improvements,\
    \ depending on how the project is ultimately authorized by Congress, and may include\
    \ lock and dam projects, if such lock and dam projects contain storage that was\
    \ authorized by Congress and is managed for multiple purposes in accordance with\
    \ congressional intent."

- label: Reservoir Regulation Schedule
  definition: A compilation of operating criteria, guidelines, guide curves, and specifications

    project, acting separately or in combination with other projects in a system.
    Schedules are usually expressed in the form of graphs and tabulations, supplemented
    by concise specifications.

  definition: 'A compilation of water control criteria, guidelines, diagrams, release

    schedules, guide curves, and specifications that basically govern the use of reservoir
    storage

    space for flood control or navigation, and other authorized purposes. In general,
    they indicate

    controlling or release functions of a water control project for these purposes.
    In general, they

    indicate controlling or limiting rates of discharge and storage space required
