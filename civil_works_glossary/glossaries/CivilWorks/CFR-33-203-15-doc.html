                    <p>A flood control project designed and constructed to have appreciable and predictable effects in preventing damage to developed areas from the impacts of hurricanes, tsunamis, and coastal storms. These effects are primarily to protect against wave action, storm surge, wind, and the complicating factors of extraordinary high tides. HSPP&#39;s include projects known as shore protection projects, shore protection structures, periodic nourishment projects, shore enhancement projects, and similar terms. Components of an HSPP may include both hard (permanent construction) and soft (sacrificial, i.e., sand) features.</p>

Repair and rehabilitation does not include improvements (betterments) to the structure, nor does repair and rehabilitation include any repair or rebuilding of a flood control structure that, in the normal course of usage, has become structurally unsound and is no longer fit to provide the level of protection for which it was designed.</p>
