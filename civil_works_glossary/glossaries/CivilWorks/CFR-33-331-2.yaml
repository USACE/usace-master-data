terms:
- label: Affected party
  definition: means a permit applicant, landowner, a lease, easement or option holder
    (i.e., an individual who has an identifiable and substantial legal interest in
    the property) who has received an approved JD, permit denial, or has declined
    a proffered individual permit.
  anchor: '1'
- label: Agent(s)

    terms are defined in this section.
  anchor: '1'
- label: Appellant
  definition: means an affected party who has filed an appeal of an approved JD, a
    permit denial or declined permit under the criteria and procedures of this part.
  anchor: '1'
- label: Approved jurisdictional determination
  definition: means a Corps document stating the presence or absence of waters of
    the United States on a parcel or a written statement and map identifying the limits
    of waters of the United States on a parcel. Approved JDs are clearly designated
    appealable actions and will include a basis of JD with the document.
  anchor: '1'
- label: Basis of jurisdictional determination
  definition: 'is a summary of the indicators that support the Corps approved JD.
    Indicators supporting the Corps approved JD can include, but are not limited to:
    indicators of wetland hydrology, hydric soils, and hydrophytic plant communities;
    indicators of ordinary high water marks, high tide lines, or mean high water marks;
    indicators of adjacency to navigable or interstate waters; indicators that the
    wetland or waterbody is of part of a tributary system; or indicators of linkages
    between isolated water bodies and interstate or foreign commerce.'
  anchor: '1'
- label: Declined permit
  definition: means a proffered individual permit, including a letter of permission,
    that an applicant has refused to accept, because he has objections to the terms
    and special conditions therein. A declined permit can also be an individual permit
    that the applicant originally accepted, but where such permit was subsequently
    modified by the district engineer, pursuant to 33 CFR 325.7, in such a manner
    that the resulting permit contains terms and special conditions that lead the
    applicant to decline the modified permit, provided that the applicant has not
    started work in waters of the United States authorized by such permit. Where an
    applicant declines a permit (either initial or modified), the applicant does not
    have a valid permit to conduct regulated activities in waters of the United States,
    and must not begin construction of the work requiring a Corps permit unless and
    until the applicant receives and accepts a valid Corps permit.
  anchor: '1'
- label: Denial determination
  definition: means a letter from the district engineer detailing the reasons a permit
    was denied with prejudice. The decision document for the project will be attached
    to the denial determination in all cases.

  altName: [ JD ]
  definition: '(JD) means a written Corps determination that a wetland and/or waterbody
    is subject to regulatory jurisdiction under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act

    jurisdiction under Section 9 or 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C.
    401 et seq.). Additionally, the term includes a written reverification of expired
    JDs and a written reverification of JDs where new information has become available
    that may affect the previously written determination. For example, such geographic
    JDs may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following determinations:
    the presence or absence of wetlands; the location(s) of the wetland boundary,
    ordinary high water mark, mean high water mark, and/or high tide line; interstate
    commerce nexus for isolated waters; and adjacency of wetlands to other waters
    of the United States. All JDs will be in writing and will be identified as either
    preliminary or approved. JDs do not include determinations that a particular activity
    requires a DA permit.'

- label: Proffered permit
  definition: "means a permit that is sent to an applicant that is in the proper format\
    \ for the applicant to sign (for a standard permit) or accept (for a letter of\
    \ permission). The term initial proffered permit as used in this part\
    \ refers to the first time a permit is sent to the applicant. The initial proffered\
    \ permit is not an appealable action. However, the applicant may object to the\
    \ terms or conditions of the initial proffered permit and, if so, a second reconsidered\
    \ permit will be sent to the applicant. The term proffered permit as\
    \ used in this part refers to the second permit that is sent to the applicant.\
    \ Such proffered permit is an appealable action."

    of the approved JD, denied permit, or declined permit, the reason(s) for the appeal,
    and any supporting data and information. No new information may be submitted.
    A grant of right of entry for the Corps to the project site is a condition of
    the RFA to allow the RO to clarify elements of the record or to conduct field
    tests or sampling for purposes directly related to the appeal. A standard RFA
    form will be provided to the affected party with the NAP form. For appeals of
    decisions related to unauthorized activities a signed tolling agreement, as required
    by 33 CFR 326.3(e)(1)(v), must be included with the RFA, unless a signed tolling
    agreement has previously been furnished to the Corps district office. The affected
    party initiates the administrative appeal process by providing an acceptable RFA
    to the appropriate Corps of Engineers division office. An acceptable RFA contains
    all the required information and provides reasons for appeal that meets the criteria
    identified in Â§ 331.5.

  definition: "refers to a document signed by any person who appeals an approved JD\
    \ associated with an unauthorized activity or applies for an after-the-fact (ATF)\
    \ permit, where the application is accepted and evaluated by the Corps. The agreement\
    \ states that the affected party agrees to have the statute of limitations regarding\
    \ any violation associated with that approved JD or application tolled\
    \ or temporarily set aside until one year after the final Corps decision, as defined\
    \ at Â§ 331.10. No ATF permit application or administrative appeal associated\
    \ with an unauthorized activity will be accepted until a tolling agreement is\
    \ furnished to the district engineer."
