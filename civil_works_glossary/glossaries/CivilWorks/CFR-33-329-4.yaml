- label: Navigable Waters
  definition: Navigable waters of the United States are those waters that are subject
    to the ebb and flow of the tide and/or are presently used, or have been used in
    the past, or may be susceptible for use to transport interstate or foreign commerce.
    A determination of navigability, once made, applies laterally over the entire
    surface of the waterbody, and is not extinguished by later actions or events which
    impede or destroy navigable capacity.
