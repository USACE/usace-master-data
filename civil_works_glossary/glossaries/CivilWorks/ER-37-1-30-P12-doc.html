                    <p>CEFMS II is a fully operational, integrated financial management system supporting agency fund control. This field-level financial management tool integrates USACE work management functions with accounting requirements prescribed under U.S. Government Standard General Ledger policies. All transactions which affect dollars (commitments, obligations, expenditures, disbursements) for all USACE missions and programs are entered into CEFMS II. CEFMS II records all transactions, stores records electronically for easy access and retrieval, and updates United States Standard General Ledgers based on each transaction. CEFMS II provides for:
a. Recording all financial transactions affecting apportionments, reapportionments, allotments, agency restrictions, financial plans, program operating plans, obligations and expenditures as well as anticipated, earned, and collected reimbursements.
b. Preparing and reconciling financial reports that display cumulative obligations and the remaining unobligated balance by appropriation and allotment and cumulative obligations by budget activity and object class.</p>

                    <h2>ADA Reporting Procedures</h2>
                    <p>The purpose of a potential ADA violation investigation is to determine if a violation has occurred. An ADA investigation is initiated by the applicable assigned individual or team and must be reported to the Army as required. One of the most important outcomes of an ADA investigation is preparing necessary reports.</p>

                    <h2>ADA Violations</h2>
                    <p>The three ADA statutes most frequently cited are title 31 USC sections 1341, 1342, and 1517. Section 1341 prohibits a federal employee from making or authorizing an expenditure or obligation exceeding an amount available in an appropriation or fund. Section 1342 prohibits a federal employee from accepting voluntary services except for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property. Similar to section 1341, section 1517 prohibits federal employees from making or authorizing an expenditure or obligation exceeding an apportionment or formal administrative subdivision of funds. Not all alleged violations unfold as actual violations of the ADA statutes; the alleged violations however represent trouble areas or pitfalls to be avoided.
Any officer or employee of the United States is prohibited from:
a. Making or authorizing an expenditure from, or creating or authorizing an obligation under, any appropriation or fund in excess of the amount available in the appropriation or fund unless authorized by law. Involving the government in any obligation to pay money before funds have been appropriated for that purpose, unless otherwise allowed by law.
c. Accepting voluntary services for the U.S., or employing personal services not authorized by law except in cases of emergency involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.
d. Making obligations or expenditures in excess of an apportionment or reapportionment or in excess of the amount permitted by agency regulations. A violation will also result from the over-expenditure of an appropriation, allotment, statutory limitation or earmark, or an obligation in advance of an appropriation.

                    <h2>Administrative Penalties</h2>
                    <p>The law provides that any officer or employee of the United States who violates the prohibitions of Title 31 USC 1341(a), 1342, 1349-1351, 1511-1516, 1517(a)-1519 will be subject to administrative discipline. The DoD FMR contains additional guidance regarding recommended disciplinary actions. Administrative discipline for a civilian employee may include written admonishment or reprimand, reduction in grade, suspension from duty without pay, or removal from office. Military personnel may be subject to appropriate administrative discipline or may be subject to action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). If a violation is determined to have been knowingly and willfully committed, there are statutory provisions applying criminal penalties. An officer or employee found responsible for committing a violation knowingly and willfully may be subject to criminal penalties. The investigating officer should consult with legal counsel to determine if the investigation should be referred to the appropriate criminal investigation organization for action.</p>

                    <p>Distribution of amounts made by OMB of amounts available for obligation in an appropriation or fund account into amounts available for specified time periods, programs, activities, projects, objects, or any combinations of these. The apportioned amount limits the obligations that may be incurred. An apportionment may be further subdivided by an agency into allotments, sub-allotments, and allocations. The OMB apportions funds from the Energy and Water Development and related agencies Appropriations Act to USACE making appropriated funds available for obligation and expenditure. The process of apportionment of funds for military appropriations, such as Operation and Maintenance, Army, can be found in Volume 14, Chapter 1 of the DoD Financial Management Regulation (FMR). Apportionment restricts, by appropriation, the quarterly amounts available for obligation to ensure an orderly distribution of funds throughout the fiscal year. Included in the apportionment are newly appropriated funds, anticipated reimbursable activity, and unobligated balances carried over from prior year appropriations. The OMB may use apportionment to restrict the use of funds when the work intended by Congress is contrary to Administration policy or not legislatively authorized. The apportioned amount limits the obligations that may be incurred. An apportionment may be further subdivided into allotments, sub-allotments, and allocations all of which are subject to the provisions of the ADA. OMB may use apportionment to restrict the use of funds when the work intended by Congress is contrary to Administration policy or not legislatively authorized. Apportionments are subject to adjustment in the event of substantially increased allotments or major revocations, a Supplemental Appropriations Act, or if appropriations are deferred or rescinded according to the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (PL 93-344). The head of an executive agency may request an apportionment under title 31 USC section 1512. This chapter serves as the governing directive on apportionments. Appendix F details the procedures for requesting the apportionment of funds in USACE.

Historically, the appropriations acts for the eight Civil Works accounts have provided that the budget authority is to be available until expended. Accordingly, all funds remaining unobligated at the end of one fiscal year have automatically resulted in carryover of budget authority to the next fiscal year without issuance of fund advice. This carry over budget authority does not apply to the regulatory program and expense Civil Works appropriations; Congress has limited these appropriations to only two years of availability. FADs must include information on the amount available, funding source, the period of availability, the position and title of the responsible official, as well as any justifications for changes in allotments as applicable.</p>

Investigating Officer is appointed by the USACE Deputy Commanding General. DASA- FO memorandum will assign a date to complete preliminary review. Per DoD FMR, preliminary review should be completed within 14 weeks from the date of initial discovery. The USACE activity that reported the alleged violation is responsible for all the costs for the investigating officer. CERM-F coordinates with HQ Legal Counsel to obtain a Legal Sufficiency letter that is submitted to DASA-FO along with the preliminary report. The preliminary review must focus on the potential violation not the corrective actions.

                    <p>Resource codes are used to classify categories of obligations and expenditures. They are classified according to the initial purpose rather than the end product or service provided. The resource codes are rolled up at object class level for financial reporting purposes. From the CEFMS II data dictionary: The specific resources within manpower, equipment, service, material, facility and real property used to accomplish the Corps mission. The code may identify a standard resource type or any component in a breakdown thereof. Resource codes are also tied to object classes. Resource codes may only belong to one object class, with the exception of OTHCONSVC, which maybe in 25% or 32%, due to the nature of this resource code and by HQ policy. EOR and resource code combinations must be of the same object class.
