terms:
- label: Flood damage reduction works in urban areas
  definition: are the adjustments in land use and the facilities (structural and non-structural)
    designed to reduce flood damages in urban areas from overflow or backwater due
    to major storms and snowmelt. They include structural and other engineering modifications
    to natural streams or to previously modified natural waterways. Flood damage reduction
    works are designed to modify flood behavior typified by temporary conditions of
    inundation of normally dry land from the overflow of rivers and streams or from
    abnormally high coastal waters due to sever storms.
- label: Storm sewer systems
  definition: are the facilities in urban areas designed to collect and convey runoff
    from rainfall or snowmelt in the urban area to natural water courses or to previously
    modified natural waterways. They include storm drains, inlets, manholes, pipes,
    culverts, conduits, sewers and sewer appurtenances, on-site storage and detention
    basins, curbs and gutters, and other small drainageways that remove or help to
    manage runoff in urban areas. Storm sewer systems are designed to solve storm
    drainage problems, which are typified by excessive accumulation of runoff in depressions;
    overland sheet flow resulting from rapid snowmelt or rainfall; and excessive accumulation
    of water at the facilities listed in this paragraph because of their limited capacity.
- label: Urban areas
  definition: "are cities, towns, or other incorporated or unincorporated political\
    \ subdivisions of States that: \n(1) Provide general local government for specific\
    \ population concentrations, and, \n(2) Occupy an essentially continuous area\
    \ of developed land, containing such structures as residences, public and commercial\
    \ buildings, and industrial sites."
