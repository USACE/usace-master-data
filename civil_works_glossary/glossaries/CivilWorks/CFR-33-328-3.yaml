terms:
- label: Adjacent wetlands
  definition: "The term adjacent wetlands means wetlands that: \n(i) Abut, meaning\
    \ to touch at least at one point or side of, a water identified in paragraph (a)(1),\
    \ (2), or (3) of this section; \n(ii) Are inundated by flooding from a water identified\
    \ in paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section in a typical year; \n(iii)\
    \ Are physically separated from a water identified in paragraph (a)(1), (2), or\
    \ (3) of this section only by a natural berm, bank, dune, or similar natural feature;\
    \ or \n(iv) Are physically separated from a water identified in paragraph (a)(1),\
    \ (2), or (3) of this section only by an artificial dike, barrier, or similar\
    \ artificial structure so long as that structure allows for a direct hydrologic\
    \ surface connection between the wetlands and the water identified in paragraph\
    \ (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section in a typical year, such as through a culvert,\
    \ flood or tide gate, pump, or similar artificial feature. An adjacent wetland\
    \ is jurisdictional in its entirety when a road or similar artificial structure\
    \ divides the wetland, as long as the structure allows for a direct hydrologic\
    \ surface connection through or over that structure in a typical year."

- label: Ditch
  definition: The term ditch means a constructed or excavated channel used to convey
    water.
  anchor: '1'
- label: Ephemeral
  definition: The term ephemeral means surface water flowing or pooling only in direct
    response to precipitation (e.g.,rain or snow fall).
  anchor: '1'
- label: High tide line
  definition: The term high tide line means the line of intersection of the land with
    the water's surface at the maximum height reached by a rising tide. The high tide
    line may be determined, in the absence of actual data, by a line of oil or scum
    along shore objects, a more or less continuous deposit of fine shell or debris
    on the foreshore or berm, other physical markings or characteristics, vegetation
    lines, tidal gages, or other suitable means that delineate the general height
    reached by a rising tide. The line encompasses spring high tides and other high
    tides that occur with periodic frequency but does not include storm surges in
    which there is a departure from the normal or predicted reach of the tide due
    to the piling up of water against a coast by strong winds, such as those accompanying
    a hurricane or other intense storm.
  anchor: '1'
- label: Intermittent
  definition: The term intermittent means surface water flowing continuously during
    certain times of the year and more than in direct response to precipitation (e.g.,
    seasonally when the groundwater table is elevated or when snowpack melts).
  anchor: '1'
- label: Jurisdictional waters
  definition: "For purposes of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq. and its\
    \ implementing regulations, subject to the exclusions in paragraph (b) of this\
    \ section, the term waters of the United States means: \n(1) The territorial\
    \ seas, and waters which are currently used, or were used in the past, or may\
    \ be susceptible to use in interstate or foreign commerce, including waters which\
    \ are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide; \n(2) Tributaries; \n(3) Lakes\
    \ and ponds, and impoundments of jurisdictional waters; and \n(4) Adjacent wetlands."
  anchor: '1'
- label: Lakes and ponds, and impoundments of jurisdictional waters
  definition: The term lakes and ponds, and impoundments of jurisdictional waters
    means standing bodies of open water that contribute surface water flow to a water
    identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section in a typical year either directly
    or through one or more waters identified in paragraph (a)(2), (3), or (4) of this
    section. A lake, pond, or impoundment of a jurisdictional water does not lose
    its jurisdictional status if it contributes surface water flow to a downstream
    jurisdictional water in a typical year through a channelized non-jurisdictional
    surface water feature, through a culvert, dike, spillway, or similar artificial
    feature, or through a debris pile, boulder field, or similar natural feature.
    A lake or pond, or impoundment of a jurisdictional water is also jurisdictional
    if it is inundated by flooding from a water identified in paragraph (a)(1), (2),
    or (3) of this section in a typical year.
  anchor: '1'
- label: Non-jurisdictional waters
  definition: "The following are not waters of the United States: \n(1) Waters\
    \ or water features that are not identified in paragraph (a)(1), (2), (3), or\
    \ (4) of this section; \n(2) Groundwater, including groundwater drained through\
    \ subsurface drainage systems; \n(3) Ephemeral features, including ephemeral streams,\
    \ swales, gullies, rills, and pools; \n(4) Diffuse stormwater run-off and directional\
    \ sheet flow over upland; \n(5) Ditches that are not waters identified in paragraph\
    \ (a)(1) or (2) of this section, and those portions of ditches constructed in\
    \ waters identified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section that do not satisfy the\
    \ conditions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section; \n(6) Prior converted cropland;\
    \ \n(7) Artificially irrigated areas, including fields flooded for agricultural\
    \ production, that would revert to upland should application of irrigation water\
    \ to that area cease; \n(8) Artificial lakes and ponds, including water storage\
    \ reservoirs and farm, irrigation, stock watering, and log cleaning ponds, constructed\
    \ or excavated in upland or in non-jurisdictional waters, so long as those artificial\
    \ lakes and ponds are not impoundments of jurisdictional waters that meet the\
    \ conditions of paragraph (c)(6) of this section;\n(9) Water-filled depressions\
    \ constructed or excavated in upland or in non-jurisdictional waters incidental\
    \ to mining or construction activity, and pits excavated in upland or in non-jurisdictional\
    \ waters for the purpose of obtaining fill, sand, or gravel; \n(10) Stormwater\
    \ control features constructed or excavated in upland or in non-jurisdictional\
    \ waters to convey, treat, infiltrate, or store stormwater run-off; \n(11) Groundwater\
    \ recharge, water reuse, and wastewater recycling structures, including detention,\
    \ retention, and infiltration basins and ponds, constructed or excavated in upland\
    \ or in non-jurisdictional waters; and \n(12) Waste treatment systems."

- label: Ordinary high water mark
  definition: The term ordinary high water mark means that line on the shore established
    by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics such as
    a clear, natural line impressed on the bank, shelving, changes in the character
    of soil, destruction of terrestrial vegetation, the presence of litter and debris,
    or other appropriate means that consider the characteristics of the surrounding
    areas.
  anchor: '1'
- label: Perennial
  definition: The term perennial means surface water flowing continuously year-round.
  anchor: '1'
- label: Prior converted cropland
  definition: The term prior converted cropland means any area that, prior to December
    23, 1985, was drained or otherwise manipulated for the purpose, or having the
    effect, of making production of an agricultural product possible. EPA and the
    Corps will recognize designations of prior converted cropland made by the Secretary
    of Agriculture. An area is no longer considered prior converted cropland for purposes
    of the Clean Water Act when the area is abandoned and has reverted to wetlands,
    as defined in paragraph (c)(16) of this section. Abandonment occurs when prior
    converted cropland is not used for, or in support of, agricultural purposes at
    least once in the immediately preceding five years. For the purposes of the Clean
    Water Act, the EPA Administrator shall have the final authority to determine whether
    prior converted cropland has been abandoned.

- label: Snowpack
  definition: The term snowpack means layers of snow that accumulate over extended
    periods of time in certain geographic regions or at high elevation (e.g., in northern
    climes or mountainous regions).
  anchor: '1'
- label: Tidal waters
  definition: Tidal Waters and waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tide. The
    terms tidal waters and waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tide mean those
    waters that rise and fall in a predictable and measurable rhythm or cycle due
    to the gravitational pulls of the moon and sun. Tidal waters and waters subject
    to the ebb and flow of the tide end where the rise and fall of the water surface
    can no longer be practically measured in a predictable rhythm due to masking by
    hydrologic, wind, or other effects.
  anchor: '1'
- label: Tributary
  definition: The term tributary means a river, stream, or similar naturally occurring
    surface water channel that contributes surface water flow to a water identified
    in paragraph (a)(1) of this section in a typical year either directly or through
    one or more waters identified in paragraph (a)(2), (3), or (4) of this section.
    A tributary must be perennial or intermittent in a typical year. The alteration
    or relocation of a tributary does not modify its jurisdictional status as long
    as it continues to satisfy the flow conditions of this definition. A tributary
    does not lose its jurisdictional status if it contributes surface water flow to
    a downstream jurisdictional water in a typical year through a channelized non-jurisdictional
    surface water feature, through a subterranean river, through a culvert, dam, tunnel,
    or similar artificial feature, or through a debris pile, boulder field, or similar
    natural feature. The term tributary includes a ditch that either relocates a tributary,
    is constructed in a tributary, or is constructed in an adjacent wetland as long
    as the ditch satisfies the flow conditions of this definition.
  anchor: '1'
- label: Typical year
  definition: The term typical year means when precipitation and other climatic variables
    are within the normal periodic range (e.g., seasonally, annually) for the geographic
    area of the applicable aquatic resource based on a rolling thirty-year period.
  anchor: '1'
- label: Upland
  definition: The term upland means any land area that under normal circumstances
    does not satisfy all three wetland factors (i.e., hydrology, hydrophytic vegetation,
    hydric soils) identified in paragraph (c)(16) of this section, and does not lie
    below the ordinary high water mark or the high tide line of a jurisdictional water.
  anchor: '1'
- label: Waste treatment system
  definition: The term waste treatment system includes all components, including lagoons
    and treatment ponds (such as settling or cooling ponds), designed to either convey
    or retain, concentrate, settle, reduce, or remove pollutants, either actively
    or passively, from wastewater prior to discharge (or eliminating any such discharge).
  anchor: '1'
- label: Wetlands
  definition: The term wetlands means areas that are inundated or saturated by surface
    or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under
    normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted
    for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes,
    bogs, and similar areas.
