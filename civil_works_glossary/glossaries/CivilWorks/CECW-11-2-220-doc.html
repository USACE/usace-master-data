                    <p>A component of work performed during the course of a project. An activity could be a process (e.g. Collection of data) or lead to a deliverable (write a report).

                    <h2>Benefit Cost Ratio</h2>
                    <p>A benefit-cost analysis which is performed to calculate and compare benefits and costs for a project to determine whether the project is a sound investment (justification/feasibility) and to see how it compares with other competing projects (ranking/priority assignment). BCR computations must be based on benefits in the latest approved economic analysis and must be no older than 3 years for New Start construction projects and no more than five years for continuing construction projects. Note distinctions of the different BCRs below:
- BCR AT APPLICABLE RATE: The BCR is the ratio of benefits to costs of all project purposes, from the last approved report or updated for budget purposes, evaluated at the applicable discount rate. If the BCR is not reported, put NA in the field and explain why in the REMARKS.
- BCR Current “The BCR with most current updated costs/benefits.
- BCR @ 7% - Using a discount rate allows for comparison of benefits and costs accruing at different points in time. The benefit-cost analysis uses discounting procedures to normalize financial outcomes over time.
- BCR National Economic Development Plan (BCR-NED) “ The objective in formulating the National Economic Development Plan is to maximize the difference between monetized benefits and costs. Benefits are increases in the net value of national outputs (goods and services) and vary by type of water resource project. The costs (opportunity costs) are the costs of the resources required or displaced to achieve the plan, such as concrete and steel for building a floodwall.
- BCR “ Locally Preferred Plan (BCR-LPP) “ A Sponsor may support formulation of an alternative plan with a scope that results in a decrease in the difference between monetized benefits and costs compared to the National Economic Development Plan</p>

                    <h2>Capability</h2>
                    <p>Capability is defined as the estimate for the amount of additional, new funding (over and above projected or actual unobligated carry-in) that, if provided in the applicable fiscal year, can either be obligated or committed for a contract solicitation effectively and efficiently in that fiscal year, consistent with law and policy, assuming that all projected or actual uncommitted carry-in to that fiscal year is obligated or committed first. (not to be confused with definition for Enterprise-Wide Capability)
- Capability on a contract work package proposed for funding in the BY does not include out- year costs of engineering and design (E&amp;D), supervision and administration (S&amp;A), or contingencies on the contract. The exception is that out-year E&amp;D, S&amp;A, and contingencies should be included if the BY is the last year that contracts are planned to be funded on the project or the study phase, since in this case including them would enable full funding of the project or phase. Furthermore, once the allocations in the President&#39;s Budget for a given FY (which becomes BY-1) have been finalized, the capability estimate for an unbudgeted, fully funded contract work package should be adjusted to include out-year E&amp;D, S&amp;A, and contingencies, among other adjustments, because future-FY funding is not certain if the unbudgeted work package is funded in a BY-1 work plan.
- Capability is stated in terms of obligations and commitments for contract solicitations, not expenditures. Capability and Amount That Could Be Used are identical, where used means obligated or committed for a contract solicitation. Project capability for a FY is the sum of its work package capabilities for that FY.</p>

                    <h2>Enterprise-Wide Capability for Allocation Strategy</h2>
                    <p>Enterprise-wide capability, or execution capacity, is the maximum amount of project capabilities that the MSC or FOA can execute in the applicable fiscal year. It is recognized that each enterprise, while it can execute the project capabilities on some of its projects, cannot execute the project capabilities on all of its projects. Enterprise-wide capability is less than the sum of project capabilities. Appropriations Committee staffs are interested in USACE enterprise- wide capabilities, particularly by business line or line item of additional funding, for the allocation Strategy (BY-1). This paragraph provides guidance on how each MSC or FOA states its enterprise-wide capability in the Allocation Strategy.
(i) The Explanatory Statements accompanying recent energy and water development appropriations acts have provided line items of additional funding that span all authorized business lines and functions, including those of lower budget priority such as bank protection and environmental infrastructure. Accordingly, enterprise-wide capability should represent a balanced mix of business lines and functions. In other words, within each business line or function a reasonable portion of work packages should be within enterprise-wide capability, and others should be beyond enterprise-wide capability. The mix is more or less governed by expectations (based on recent Explanatory Statements and House and Senate Reports) for funding of budgeted work and the line items of additional funding. (ii) The MSC or FOA should use performance to determine, within each business line or function, which work packages are within enterprise capability, and which are not. All budgeted work packages should be first-added within enterprise capability, and unbudgeted work packages should be next-added.
(iii) The MSC or FOA should signify which work packages are within enterprise-wide capability, or not, by checking the &#34;Funding Pot&#34; box, or not, in the &#34;Recommended for Funding&#34; field under the Funding tab in the Civil Works Integrated Funding Database (CWIFD). To respond to Congressional inquiries for USACE-wide enterprise capability for a business line or function, HQUSACE will aggregate across USACE the capabilities of work packages in that business line or function that have the Funding Pot box checked.</p>

                    <p>LoP is a management decision in the context of the available maintenance resources, maintenance demands of an asset, and asset service demands or capacity.

Managers should understand the minimum funding levels necessary to meet regulatory and safety requirements as caretaker of the facility/asset. Beyond this, a range of facility performance levels are available. In the budget context, LoP&#39;s may be broadly grouped No Mission (Red), Partial Mission (Yellow), Full Mission (Green). Managers must understand the range of performance available for the facility and the associated investments required to achieve various performance levels. Work packages are formulated to express the investment necessary to achieve a given performance level for the facility/asset. Further definition of the three LOPs: No Mission LOP is funding required to simply own a project; Partial Mission represents the additional funding required to deliver the majority of project benefits, but not meet all requirements; and Full Mission includes the additional funding required to deliver all project benefits and fully preserve the facility for the foreseeable future.</p>

                    <h2>Major Rehabilitation</h2>
                    <p>Rehabilitation projects are projects to restore or ensure continuation of project functions or outputs. Section 205 of P.L.102-580 defines rehabilitation with respect to inland waterway projects, as either:
1. Economically justified structural work for restoration of a major project feature that extends the life of the feature significantly and will take at least 2 years to complete, and has a capital cost of at least $8,000,000, adjusted for changes in price levels (reliability improvements). The updated threshold for (a) is $ 21 million.
2. Structural modifications that enhance operational efficiency and that have a capital cost of at least $1,000,000, adjusted for changes in price levels (efficiency improvements). Section 205 of P.L. 102-580 (WRDA 1992) was amended by Section 2006 of P.L. 113-121, WRRDA 2014, which increased the major rehabilitation threshold from $8,000,000 to $20,000,000. The updated threshold for 1. is 21.5 million and for 2. is 2.1 million. By policy these thresholds also apply to all Business Lines / Missions.</p>

                    <p>An asset status applied to facilities when a decision has been made to suspend operations for an extended period of time and for which maintenance measures have been taken to prevent deterioration of essential systems. Mothballing generally results in higher first-year costs, but future annual costs are lower due to reduced maintenance and repair requirements. Mothball status is distinct from caretaker or standby status; corresponds to the Federal Real Property Indicator status inactive. Mothball status is defined at the project or project site level, not the feature level. The total time to deactivate and then to reactivate a facility, including the mothballed period, generally exceeds 36 months. In addition to the conditions indicated above, the following conditions characterize mothballed facilities:
1. Utility systems and collateral equipment have been properly prepared for long-term inactivation without significant deterioration. Selected systems, such as cathodic and fire detection systems are kept in operation and routinely inspected.
2. The facility interior is equipped with appropriate environmental control to prevent significant deterioration.
3. Hazardous materials have been removed.
4. The facility exterior envelope is inspected routinely and the integrity and appearance of the exterior shell are maintained.
5. Personal property is reported to the USACE Logistic Agency for reutilization.</p>

(1) Remaining Costs. Consider anticipated Federal and non-Federal allocations and other non- Federal costs through the BY-1 as sunk, and exclude them from the RBRCR computation. The remaining costs will be the Federal and non-Federal allocations as of the end of BY-1 based on the current project cost estimate and allocations from prior years and on the President&#39;s Budget for BY-2 in October 2017 dollars. Where the project includes completed separable elements, independent units and/or useful increments, OMRR&amp;R costs for completed units/increments will also be considered sunk, and only OMRR&amp;R for remaining units/increments will be considered in remaining project costs. The remaining costs should include any reimbursements still needing to be paid for work already completed.
(2) Remaining Benefits. Where the project includes completed separable elements, independent units and/or useful increments, the amount of annual benefits that would be expected to accrue over the period of analysis for completed or functioning components of the total project will be considered sunk and excluded from the RBRCR computation. Sunk benefits for projects that have reimbursable features should be estimated based on the reimbursable costs expended and an estimate on the amount of sunk benefits that would be associated with that level of expenditure. Remaining benefits are those that will be attainable in the BY or thereafter only if project features not completed with allocations through BY-1 are completed and operated and maintained.</p>
