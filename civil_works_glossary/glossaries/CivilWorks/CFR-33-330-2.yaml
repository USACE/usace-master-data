terms:
- label: Authorization
  definition: means that specific activities that qualify for an NWP may proceed,
    provided that the terms and conditions of the NWP are met. After determining that
    the activity complies with all applicable terms and conditions, the prospective
    permittee may assume an authorization under an NWP. This assumption is subject
    to the DE's authority to determine if an activity complies with the terms and
    conditions of an NWP. If requested by the permittee in writing, the DE will verify
    in writing that the permittee's proposed activity complies with the terms and
    conditions of the NWP. A written verification may contain activity-specific conditions
    and regional conditions which a permittee must satisfy for the authorization to
    be valid.

- label: Discretionary authority
  definition: means the authority described in Â§Â§ 330.1(d) and 330.4(e) which the
    Chief of Engineers delegates to division or district engineers to modify an NWP
    authorization by adding conditions, to suspend an NWP authorization, or to revoke
    an NWP authorization and thus require individual permit authorization.

- label: Filled area
  definition: means the area within jurisdictional waters which is eliminated or covered
    as a direct result of the discharge (i.e., the area actually covered by the discharged
    material). It does not include areas excavated nor areas impacted as an indirect
    effect of the fill.
  anchor: '1'
- label: Headwaters
  definition: means non-tidal rivers, streams, and their lakes and impoundments, including
    adjacent wetlands, that are part of a surface tributary system to an interstate
    or navigable water of the United States upstream of the point on the river or
    stream at which the average annual flow is less than five cubic feet per second.
    The DE may estimate this point from available data by using the mean annual area
    precipitation, area drainage basin maps, and the average runoff coefficient, or
    by similar means. For streams that are dry for long periods of the year, DEs may
    establish the point where headwaters begin as that point on the stream where a
    flow of five cubic feet per second is equaled or exceeded 50 percent of the time.
  anchor: '1'
- label: Isolated waters
  definition: "means those non-tidal waters of the United States that are: \n(1) Not\
    \ part of a surface tributary system to interstate or navigable waters of the\
    \ United States; and \n(2) Not adjacent to such tributary waterbodies."
  anchor: '1'
- label: Nationwide Permit
  definition: "Nationwide  permit refers to a type of general permit which authorizes\
    \ activities on a nationwide basis unless specifically limited. (Another type\
    \ of general permit is a regional permit which is issued by division\
    \ or district engineers on a regional basis in accordance with 33 CFR part 325).\
    \ (See 33 CFR 322.2(f) and 323.2(h) for the definition of a general permit.)"
  anchor: '1'
- label: Single and complete project
  definition: "means the total project proposed or accomplished by one owner/developer\
    \ or partnership or other association of owners/developers. For example, if construction\
    \ of a residential development affects several different areas of a headwater\
    \ or isolated water, or several different headwaters or isolated waters, the cumulative\
    \ total of all filled areas should be the basis for deciding whether or not the\
    \ project will be covered by an NWP. For linear projects, the single and complete\
    \ project (i.e., single and complete crossing) will apply to each crossing\
    \ of a separate water of the United States (i.e., single waterbody) at that location;\
    \ except that for linear projects crossing a single waterbody several times at\
    \ separate and distant locations, each crossing is considered a single and complete\
    \ project. However, individual channels in a braided stream or river, or individual\
    \ arms of a large, irregularly-shaped wetland or lake, etc., are not separate\
    \ waterbodies."

- label: Special aquatic sites
  definition: means wetlands, mudflats, vegetated shallows, coral reefs, riffle and
    pool complexes, sanctuaries, and refuges as defined at 40 CFR 230.40 through 230.45.
  anchor: '1'
- label: Terms and conditions
  definition: "The terms of an NWP are the limitations and provisions included\
    \ in the description of the NWP itself. The conditions of NWPs are additional\
    \ provisions which place restrictions or limitations on all of the NWPs. These\
    \ are published with the NWPs. Other conditions may be imposed by district or\
    \ division engineers on a geographic, category-of-activity, or activity-specific\
    \ basis (See 33 CFR 330.4(e))."
