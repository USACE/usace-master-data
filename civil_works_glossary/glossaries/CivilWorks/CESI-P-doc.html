                    <p>USACE assigns mission areas as specific lines of business &#39;“ i.e., business programs. These programs provide a framework for planning, programming, budgeting execution and control to generate public benefits. These business programs and activities are no longer managed in isolation or confined in scope, but instead are interconnected. Business line managers run the business programs. For example, the Civil Works mission includes eight lines of business: navigation, flood risk management, environment, hydropower, regulatory, recreation, emergency management, and water storage for water supply. The military mission includes five lines of business: major construction, installation support, real estate, contingency operations, environmental, and interagency and international affairs.&#39;</p>

                    <h2>Chief Financial Officer&#39;s Act of 1990</h2>
                    <p>The Chief Financial Officer&#39;s Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-576) establishes expectations for agencies to develop and deploy modern financial management systems to routinely produce accurate, reliable, and timely program cost information; and to develop results-oriented reports on the government&#39;s financial condition. Enacted November 15, 1990, this act was directed at correcting long-standing shortcomings in financial systems, internal controls, and the use of assets. The principal provisions of the Act include establishing CFO organizations in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and each agency; improving accounting, reporting, and auditing practices; improving financial systems; and improving asset management policies. The act establishes a centralized financial management structure within OMB and in major departments and agencies. It strengthens financial management internal controls by requiring (a) preparation of five-year financial management systems improvement plans, both government-wide and in the 23 agencies covered by the act; (b) preparation of financial statements and audits of selected activities of agencies to hold agency heads accountable for their operations; and (c) annual reporting to the President and Congress on the status of general and financial management in the federal government. The act also lays out a strategy for producing audited financial statements. In addition, the act mandates the establishment of a government-wide CFO Council to support the CFO Act by providing a forum for achieving consensus on financial management policies and priorities. http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/npr/library/misc/cfo.html</p>

                    <h2>Civil Works Program Five-Year Development Plan</h2>
                    <p>This plan presents projections of discretionary budget authority (funding) for the Army Civil Works program for Fiscal Years five years post-budget. These are estimates and are usually presented based on two scenarios for overall funding. One is a base plan scenario, constrained by beginning with the budget level of the president and growing at OMB formula-driven funding levels over the five-year period, holding the mix of accounts at the same percentage as the budget over the period. These are OMB estimated account data for the out-years and do not represent the President&#39;s proposed levels for these individual agencies, accounts, or programs. The enhanced plan scenario begins with the expected appropriations prior to the budget year (FY-1), and grows for projected changes in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) price index. Within the overall funding amount provided under the enhanced plan, the percentage allocation of funding among accounts, that is, the funding mix, is permitted to vary from the base budget mix. For each plan, subsequent year&#39;s budget requests will be made in the future and therefore the out-year numbers with each plan represent placeholders, pending decisions in future years.</p>

                    <h2>Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996</h2>
                    <p>The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (formerly the Information Technology Management Act of 1995) (Public Law 104-106) repeals Section 111 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 USC 759), often referred to as the Brooks Act, which gave the General Services Administration (GSA) exclusive authority to acquire computer resources for all of the federal government. Clinger-Cohen assigns overall responsibility for the acquisition and management of information technology (IT) in the federal government to the Director, Office of Management and Budget (OMB). It also gives authority to acquire IT resources to the head of each executive agency and makes them responsible for effectively managing their IT investments. Among other provisions, the act requires agencies to (a) base decisions about IT investments on quantitative and qualitative factors associated with the costs, benefits, and risks of those investments; (b) use performance data to demonstrate how well the IT expenditures support improvements to agency program; and (c) appoint CIOs to carry out the IT management provisions of the act and the broader information resources management requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The Act also encourages agencies to evaluate and adopt best management and acquisition practices used by private- and public-sector organizations. The focus of this Act is on requiring agencies to develop and maintain an integrated, systems architecture. Such a cohesive architecture can help (1) ensure an agency invests only in integrated, enterprise-wide business solutions and (2) move resources away from non-value added legacy business systems and nonintegrated system development efforts.</p>

                    <h2>Government Performance Results Act of 1993</h2>
                    <p>In 1993, Congress passed and the President signed into law a bipartisan initiative designed to fundamentally change the way government works. Known as the GPRA or Results Act for short, this law dramatically changes the federal government&#39;&#39;s budgeting and policymaking mechanisms. The act shifts managerial emphasis to actual program execution and comparison of results with desired outcomes. This legislation promotes a focus on results, service, quality, and customer satisfaction. The GPRA has become the primary legislative framework through which agencies are required to set strategic goals, measure performance, and report on the degree to which goals are met. The act requires the development of multi-year strategic plans based on long-term goals and annual performance plans with specific indicators to measure performance. The act also creates a process for agencies to use to measure their annual financial and program performance by identifying four key performance indicators: output, outcome, efficiency, and effectiveness. Such objective measurement means that funding decisions are based on program effectiveness rather than supposition, ultimately providing Congress with better information for allocating resources.&#39;</p>

                    <h2>Impact</h2>
                    <p>An impact measure is a measure of the direct or indirect effects or consequences resulting from achieving program goals. An impact assessment is the comparison of actual program outcomes with estimates of the outcomes that would have occurred in the absence of the program; for example, by comparing the outcome for a randomly selected group receiving an agency service to a randomly selected group not receiving the service. The measurement of impact is generally done through special comparison-type studies and not simply by using data regularly collected through program information systems. Impact indicators are useful for understanding the eventual effects of government programs. OMB guidance for GPRA implementation discusses impact indicators, but GPRA itself does not. An input measure is a measure of what an agency or manager has available to carry out the program or activity to achieve an output or outcome. These can include employees, funding, equipment or facilities, supplies on hand, goods or services received, and work processes or rules. Services from a resource base (e.g., staff expertise and time) are defined as inputs to a program. Increments to a resource base (e.g., newly trained personnel) are defined as outputs or outcomes. (A program output or outcome could be negative; for example, net depletion of a resource base). </p>

The chief source of guidance for the NMS is the National Security Strategy document. The NMS Report must provide a description of the strategic environment and the opportunities and challenges that affect United States national interests and United States national security. The Report must describe the most significant regional threats to US national interests and security as well as the international threats posed by terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, and asymmetric challenges. After describing the security environment in which military forces will operate, the NMS Report must specify the &#39;ends&#39;, &#39;ways&#39;, and &#39;means&#39; of the strategy. US national military objectives are the &#39;ends&#39;, describing what the Armed Forces are expected to accomplish. The NMS report describes the relationship of those objectives to the strategic environment, regional, and international threats. Strategic and operational concepts are the &#39;ways&#39; of the strategy and describe how the Armed Forces conduct military operations to accomplish the specified military objectives. Finally, the NMS report must describe the adequacy of capabilities -- the &#39;means&#39;-- required to achieve objectives within an acceptable level of military and strategic risk.</p>

The framers of the Government Performance Results Act of 1993 recognized that in rare instances it may not be feasible to measure the results of a federal program quantitatively. If an agency, in consultation with the Director of Office of Management and Budget, determines that it is not feasible to express performance goals for a particular program in an objective, quantifiable, measurable form, the Director of Office of Management and Budget may authorize an alternative form. Even with the alternative form, Government Performance Results Act of 1993 seeks clear statement of a program&#39;s goals and clear standards for identifying progress in meeting the goals. There may be several performance goals for any general goal in a strategic plan.</p>

                    <h2>Performance Measures</h2>
                    <p>For most performance goals, a number of performance indicators should be developed -- preferably a range of related performance indicators (such as quantity, quality, timeliness, cost, and outcome) so that managers can balance priorities among competing subÂ­ goals. A performance measure is a particular value or characteristic used to indicate the program&#39;s output or outcome in relation to program goals. Under GPRA, an output measure is a tabulation, calculation, or recording of activity or effort and can be expressed in a quantitative or qualitative manner. Although the text of GPRA does not specify a distinction between outputs and activities, an important purpose of the Act is to focus attention beyond effort or activity in order to assess outputs and outcomes. Thus, OMB guidance differentiates between outputs (e.g., graduates) and production activities (e.g., teaching). An outcome measure is an assessment of the results of a program compared to its intended purpose.</p>

The POM includes an analysis of missions, objectives, alternative methods to accomplish objectives, and allocation of resources. With the implementation of a two-year budget cycle, a new document&#39;”the Program Change Proposal (PCP)&#39;”was introduced into the budgeting process to address urgent matters that need action during the off-budget year. The Military Services and Defense agencies use POM in the even-numbered on-budget years to develop proposed programs consistent with the Joint Programming Guidance (JPG) and to submit proposed programming. In addition to the current budget year, the POM is a seven-year plan that is organized within program categories, such as conventional forces or special operations; and by type of resource, such as funding or manpower. POM is reviewed by program review teams comprising members from the military departments, Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), defense agencies, and OSD staff. The results of this review are presented to the Senior Level Review Group (SLRG) for discussion. In addition, the Joint Chiefs conduct a concurrent checks-and-balances review of POM, focusing on the balance and capabilities of the proposed forces levels. Both reviews are presented to the Secretary of Defense prior to his/her decisions in the Program Decision Memoranda (PDM).</p>

The Campaign Plan aligns with the strategic plans of USACE programs through a synthesis activity. In doing so, this plan gives a single and unified vision statement and thrust to the work for all USACE organizations and its employees. Strategic planning is a continuous process. The Campaign Plan is fully reviewed and updated every three or four years. Interim adjustments may be made, as needed, sometime in parallel with the various strategic plans, implementation plans and associated performance plans.</p>
