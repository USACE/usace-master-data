    by the embankment. The embankment may be built of conventional materials but sometimes
    incorporates suitable waste products.
    o. Masonry dam. Any dam constructed mainly of stone, brick, or concrete blocks
    jointed with mortar. A dam having only a masonry facing should not be referred
    to as a masonry dam. p. Mine tailings dam. An industrial waste dam in which the

- label: Dam Safety
  definition: Dam safety is the art and science of ensuring the integrity and viability
    of dams such that they do not present unacceptable risks to the public, property,
    and the environment. It requires the collective application of engineering principles
    and experience, and a philosophy of risk management that recognizes that a dam
    is a structure whose safe functioning is not explicitly determined by its original
    design and construction. It also includes all actions taken to routinely monitor,
    evaluate, identify or predict dam safety issues and consequences related to failure
    including ensuring all reservoir regulation activities are performed in accordance
    with established water control plans in support of dam safety concerns. These
    actions are to be performed in concert with activities to document, publicize,

  altName: [DSAC System]
  definition: The Dam Safety Action Classification system is intended to provide consistent
    and systematic guidelines for appropriate actions to address the dam safety issues
    and deficiencies of USACE dams. USACE dams are assigned a DSAC class informed
    by their incremental flood risk considered as a combination of probability of
    failure and potential life safety, economic, environmental, or other consequences.
    The DSAC table presents different levels and urgencies of actions that are commensurate
    with the different levels of incremental flood risk associated with USACE dams.
    These actions range from immediate recognition of a very high urgency requiring
    extraordinary and immediate action for dams considered critically near failure
    or dams with very high incremental flood risk through normal level of urgency
    for the operations and dam safety activities for dams with very low incremental
    flood risk and that meet all essential USACE guideline.

    “ The purposes of a dam safety program are to protect life, property, and the
    environment by ensuring that all dams are designed, constructed, operated, and
    maintained as safely and effectively as is reasonably possible. Accomplishing
    these purposes require commitments to continually inspect, evaluate, and document
    the design, construction, operations, maintenance, rehabilitation, and emergency
    preparedness of each dam and the associated public. It also requires the archiving
    of documents on the inspections and history of dams and the training of personnel
    who inspect, evaluate, operate, and maintain them. Programs must instill an awareness
    of dams and the potential hazard that they may present in the owners, the users,
    the public, and the local and national decision-makers. On both local and national
    scales, program purposes also include periodic reporting on the degree of program
    implementation. Key to accomplishing these purposes is to attract, train, and
    retain a staff proficient in the art and science of dam design.

  altName: [ MCE ]
  definition: The MCE is defined as the greatest earthquake that can reasonably be
    expected to be generated by a specific source on the basis of seismological and
    geological evidence. Since a project site may be affected by earthquakes generated
    by various sources, each with its own fault mechanism, maximum earthquake magnitude,
    and distance from the site, multiple MCE's may be defined for the site, each
    with characteristic ground motion parameters and spectral shape. The MCE is determined
    by a DSHA and input from PSHA when site specific studies are performed.
  anchor: '498'
- label: Earthquake, Maximum Design (MDE)
  altName: [ MDE ]
  definition: The MDE is the maximum level of ground motion for which a structure
    is designed or evaluated. The associated performance requirement is that the project
    performs without catastrophic failure, such as uncontrolled release of a reservoir,
    although severe damage or economic loss may be tolerated. For critical features,
    the MDE is the same as the MCE. For all other features, the MDE must be selected
    as a minimum of event with a 10% probability of exceedance in 100 years. ( This
    corresponds to an average return period of 975 years). The longer or shorter return
    period for the non critical features can be use if warranted. The MDE can be characterized
    as a deterministic or probabilistic event.

    from the dam site or in terms of the characteristics of the time history of free-field
    ground motions, for which the safety of the dam and critical structures associated
    with the dam are to be evaluated. In many cases, this earthquake will be the maximum
    credible earthquake to which the dam will be exposed. However, in other cases
    where the possible sources of ground motion are not easily apparent, it may be
    a motion with prescribed characteristics selected on the basis of a probabilistic
    assessment of the ground motions that may occur in the vicinity of the dam. To
    be considered safe, it should be demonstrated that the dam can withstand this
    level of earthquake shaking without release of water from the reservoir.
  anchor: '499'

  definition: Earthquake time history records developed from mathematical models that
    use white noise, filtered white noise, and stationary and non-stationary filtered
    white noise, or theoretical seismic source models of failure in the fault zone.

- label: Economic Consequences
  definition: Direct and indirect losses of the failure of a dam and other economic
    impacts on the regional or national economy. Part of the direct losses is the

- label: Economic Regret
  definition: "Condition when the costs of making a wrong decision are deemed\
    \ to be high. The basic concept of regret is the difference between the outcome\
    \ of the \"best alternative for a future, uncertain state\" and outcome of each\
    \ alternative evaluated for that state. So it is really the potential costs, if\
    \ you choose an alternative as the best given some future scenario, and a different\
    \ future actually happens. All regret values are determined by comparing each\
    \ alternative to the best (e.g. maximum net benefits) for a scenario. So you end\
    \ up with a regret matrix with scenarios as column headings and alternatives as\
    \ row headings. There is nothing in the notion about regret about it being \"\
    too high.\" The minimax principle is usually applied to regret to identify the\
    \ plan or plans that are robust across multiple future scenarios."

  definition: Drill “ A drill is the lowest level exercise that involves an actual
    exercise. It tests, develops, or maintains skills in a single emergency response
    procedure. An example of a drill is an in-house exercise performed to verify the
    validity of telephone numbers and other means of communication along with the
    response of the entity responsible for the dam. A drill is considered a necessary
    part of ongoing training.
  anchor: '500'
- label: Emergency Exercise
  definition: Full Scale “ The full scale exercise is the most complex level of
    exercise. It evaluates the operational capability of all facets of the emergency
    management system (both dam operator and state and local emergency management
    agencies) interactively in a stressful environment with the actual mobilization
    of personnel and resources. It includes deployment to and movement in the field
    of personnel and equipment to demonstrate coordination and response capability.
    The participants actively "play out" their roles in a dynamic environment that
    provides the highest degree of realism possible for the simulated event. Actual
    evacuation of critical residents may be exercised if previously announced to the
    public.
  anchor: '500'
- label: Emergency Exercise
  definition: Functional “ The functional exercise is the highest level exercise
    that does not involve the full activation of the entity responsible for dam operation
    and state and local emergency management agency field personnel and facilities
    or test evacuation of residents downstream of the dam. It involves the various
    levels of the entity responsible for dam operation and state and local emergency
    management personnel that would be involved in an actual emergency. The functional
    exercise takes place in a stress-induced environment with time constraints and
    involves the simulation of a dam failure and other specified events. The participants
    "act out" their actual roles. The exercise is designed to evaluate both the internal
    capabilities and responses of the entity responsible for dam operation and the
    workability of the information in the EAP used by the emergency management officials
    to carry out their responsibilities. The functional exercise also is designed
    to evaluate the coordination activities between the entity responsible for dam
    operation and emergency management personnel.

- label: Emergency Exercise
  definition: Orientation Seminar “ This exercise is a seminar that involves bringing
    together those with a role or interest in an EAP, i.e., entity responsible for
    dam operation and state and local emergency management agencies, to discuss the
    EAP and initial plans for an annual drill or more in-depth comprehensive exercise.
    The seminar does not involve an actual exercise of the EAP. Instead, it is a meeting
    that enables each participant to become familiar with the EAP and the roles, responsibilities,
    and procedures of those involved. An orientation seminar can also be used to discuss
    and describe technical matters with involved, non-technical personnel.

  definition: Direct and indirect consequences that cannot be measured in monetary
    terms. These stem from the impacts of the dam failure flood and loss of pool on
    environmental, cultural, and historic resources. In most cases, the assessment
    of the impacts of dam failure will be the reporting of area and type of habitat
    impacted, habitat of threatened and endangered species impacted, number and type
    of historic sites and the cultural significance areas impacted. An indirect non-monetary
    consequence could be the exposure of people and the ecosystem to hazardous and
    toxic material released from landfills, warehouses, and other facilities. An estimate
    of the locations and quantities should be compiled identifying where significant
    quantities are concentrated.

    status. These regulations include: Engineer Circulars, Engineer Regulations, Engineer
    Manuals, Engineer Pamphlets and Engineer Technical Letters; and Engineering and
    Construction Bulletins, and other official HQUSACE dam safety-related Policy Letters
    and guidance. Current state-of-practice guidance is summarized in Appendix F.'
  anchor: '502'
- label: Event Tree(s)
  definition: An event tree serves as a model of the physical dam system in which
    each node represents an identifiable behavior of the dam or its physical components
    and each event should be something that happens in space or time (Hartford and
    Baecher, 2004). An event tree begins with a single initiating branch on the left
    hand side and progress toward more detailed events to the right hand side. Starting
    with an initiating event branch (e.g. a severe flood, an earthquake or other natural
    or human caused hazards), each node is divided at various nodes to generate all
    possible subsequent events. Each node is an origin of possible subsequent events
    and each branch is a possible event that is a logical consequence of the one before
    it, and a necessary precursor of the one that follows. As the number of events
    increases, structure fans outs like the branches of a tree until each event tree
    chain comes to a terminal branch. Terminal branches are the system outcome or
    system effect of an initiating event which leads to adverse consequences or failure
    of the system completely or partially. The tree may be extended to represent the
    economic damages and life loss consequences associated with the terminal branches.

  altName: [ PFMA ]
  definition: "A PFMA is an examination of potential failure modes for an\
    \ existing dam by a team of persons who are qualified either by experience and\\\
    or education to evaluate dams. It is based on a review of existing data and information,\
    \ first hand input from field and operational personnel, site inspection, completed\
    \ engineering analyses, discussion of dam characteristics, failure causes and\
    \ an understanding of the consequences of failure. The PFMA is intended to provide\

- label: Probability of Individual Life Loss
  definition: "The probability of individual life loss, which is used in the evaluation\
    \ of Individual incremental life safety risk, is not necessarily the same as the\
    \ probability of failure that is used in the evaluation of Reclamation's APF\
    \ guideline. The probability of life loss is based on the probability of failure\
    \ and a consideration of exposure factors such as day-night differences in PAR\
    \ and evaluation and the seasonal presence of people in campgrounds. The level\
    \ of detail that is appropriate for characterizing exposure factors should be\
    \ decision driven, although it is noted that FEMA's HAZUS data base\
    \ provides opportunity for some level of automation in capturing information on\
    \ exposure factors. The distinction between probability of failure and probability\
    \ of life loss is particularly important for navigation dams, but can also have\
    \ a significant effect on the evaluation of life safety for other types of dams.\
    \ It applies to societal risk as well as to individual risk."

  definition: The risk of widespread or large scale detriment from the realization
    of a defined risk, the implication being that the consequence would be on such
    a scale as to provoke a socio/political response, and/or that the risk (that is,
    the likelihood combined with the consequence) provokes public discussion and is
    effectively regulated by society as a whole through its political processes and
    regulatory mechanisms. Such large risks are typically unevenly distributed, as
    are their attendant benefits. Thus the construction of a dam represents a risk
    to those close by and a benefit to those further off, or a process may harm some
    future generation more than the present one. The distribution and balancing of
    such major costs and benefits is a classic function of Government, subject to
    public discussion and discussion (HSE, 1995 reference A.144) and (ANCOLD October
    2003) (reference A.130).
