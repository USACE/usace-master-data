  altName: [Business Program]
  definition: "USACE assigns mission areas as specific lines of business '“ i.e.,
    business programs. These programs provide a framework for planning, programming,
    budgeting execution and control to generate public benefits. These business programs
    and activities are no longer managed in isolation or confined in scope, but instead
    are interconnected. Business line managers run the business programs. For example,
    the Civil Works mission includes eight lines of business: navigation, flood risk
    management, environment, hydropower, regulatory, recreation, emergency management,
    and water storage for water supply. The military mission includes five lines of
    business: major construction, installation support, real estate, contingency operations,
    environmental, and interagency and international affairs.'"

- label: Chief Financial Officer's Act of 1990
  definition: "The Chief Financial Officer's Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-576) establishes
    expectations for agencies to develop and deploy modern financial management systems
    to routinely produce accurate, reliable, and timely program cost information;
    and to develop results-oriented reports on the government's financial condition.
    Enacted November 15, 1990, this act was directed at correcting long-standing shortcomings
    in financial systems, internal controls, and the use of assets. The principal
    provisions of the Act include establishing CFO organizations in the Office of
    Management and Budget (OMB) and each agency; improving accounting, reporting,
    and auditing practices; improving financial systems; and improving asset management
    policies. The act establishes a centralized financial management structure within
    OMB and in major departments and agencies. It strengthens financial management
    internal controls by requiring (a) preparation of five-year financial management
    systems improvement plans, both government-wide and in the 23 agencies covered
    by the act; (b) preparation of financial statements and audits of selected activities
    of agencies to hold agency heads accountable for their operations; and (c) annual
    reporting to the President and Congress on the status of general and financial
    management in the federal government. The act also lays out a strategy for producing
    audited financial statements. In addition, the act mandates the establishment
    of a government-wide CFO Council to support the CFO Act by providing a forum for
    achieving consensus on financial management policies and priorities. http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/npr/library/misc/cfo.html"

- label: Civil Works Program Five-Year Development Plan
  altName: [ FYDP ]
  definition: "This plan presents projections of discretionary budget authority (funding)
    for the Army Civil Works program for Fiscal Years five years post-budget. These
    are estimates and are usually presented based on two scenarios for overall funding.
    One is a base plan scenario, constrained by beginning with the budget level of
    the president and growing at OMB formula-driven funding levels over the five-year
    period, holding the mix of accounts at the same percentage as the budget over
    the period. These are OMB estimated account data for the out-years and do not
    represent the President's proposed levels for these individual agencies, accounts,
    or programs. The enhanced plan scenario begins with the expected appropriations
    prior to the budget year (FY-1), and grows for projected changes in the Gross
    Domestic Product (GDP) price index. Within the overall funding amount provided
    under the enhanced plan, the percentage allocation of funding among accounts,
    that is, the funding mix, is permitted to vary from the base budget mix. For each
    plan, subsequent year's budget requests will be made in the future and therefore
    the out-year numbers with each plan represent placeholders, pending decisions
    in future years."

- label: Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996
  definition: "The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (formerly the Information Technology Management
    Act of 1995) (Public Law 104-106) repeals Section 111 of the Federal Property
    and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 USC 759), often referred to as the
    Brooks Act, which gave the General Services Administration (GSA) exclusive authority
    to acquire computer resources for all of the federal government. Clinger-Cohen
    assigns overall responsibility for the acquisition and management of information
    technology (IT) in the federal government to the Director, Office of Management
    and Budget (OMB). It also gives authority to acquire IT resources to the head
    of each executive agency and makes them responsible for effectively managing their
    IT investments. Among other provisions, the act requires agencies to (a) base
    decisions about IT investments on quantitative and qualitative factors associated
    with the costs, benefits, and risks of those investments; (b) use performance
    data to demonstrate how well the IT expenditures support improvements to agency
    program; and (c) appoint CIOs to carry out the IT management provisions of the
    act and the broader information resources management requirements of the Paperwork
    Reduction Act. The Act also encourages agencies to evaluate and adopt best management
    and acquisition practices used by private- and public-sector organizations. The
    focus of this Act is on requiring agencies to develop and maintain an integrated,
    systems architecture. Such a cohesive architecture can help (1) ensure an agency
    invests only in integrated, enterprise-wide business solutions and (2) move resources
    away from non-value added legacy business systems and nonintegrated system development
    efforts."

- label: Government Performance Results Act of 1993
  definition: "In 1993, Congress passed and the President signed into law a bipartisan
    initiative designed to fundamentally change the way government works. Known as
    the GPRA or Results Act for short, this law dramatically changes the federal government''s
    budgeting and policymaking mechanisms. The act shifts managerial emphasis to actual
    program execution and comparison of results with desired outcomes. This legislation
    promotes a focus on results, service, quality, and customer satisfaction. The
    GPRA has become the primary legislative framework through which agencies are required
    to set strategic goals, measure performance, and report on the degree to which
    goals are met. The act requires the development of multi-year strategic plans
    based on long-term goals and annual performance plans with specific indicators
    to measure performance. The act also creates a process for agencies to use to
    measure their annual financial and program performance by identifying four key
    performance indicators: output, outcome, efficiency, and effectiveness. Such objective
    measurement means that funding decisions are based on program effectiveness rather
    than supposition, ultimately providing Congress with better information for allocating
    resources.'"

- label: HQ Staff Implementation Plan
  altName: [ IPlan, MSC implementation plan, Staff Implementation Plan/Staff IPlan, Staff Area Implementation Plan ]
  definition: "HQ staff directors and chiefs formulate HQ Staff IPlans, when necessary
    and appropriate, to implement Program Area actions in support of the Campaign
    Plan, improve management and accountability, and respond to new strategic direction
    and/or strategic vision. Staff IPlans establish the overall purpose and strategic
    direction of the functional area support activities, including goals, objectives
    and performance metrics or indicators. The Command Council must receive presentations
    and concur with Staff IPlans, followed by the commander's approval. The plans
    are updated, reviewed, and approved again as required by the commander."
  anchor: '69'
- label: Impact
  altName: [ Measures, Outcome Measure ]
  definition: "An impact measure is a measure of the direct or indirect effects or
    consequences resulting from achieving program goals. An impact assessment is the
    comparison of actual program outcomes with estimates of the outcomes that would
    have occurred in the absence of the program; for example, by comparing the outcome
    for a randomly selected group receiving an agency service to a randomly selected
    group not receiving the service. The measurement of impact is generally done through
    special comparison-type studies and not simply by using data regularly collected
    through program information systems. Impact indicators are useful for understanding
    the eventual effects of government programs. OMB guidance for GPRA implementation
    discusses impact indicators, but GPRA itself does not. An input measure is a measure
    of what an agency or manager has available to carry out the program or activity
    to achieve an output or outcome. These can include employees, funding, equipment
    or facilities, supplies on hand, goods or services received, and work processes
    or rules. Services from a resource base (e.g., staff expertise and time) are defined
    as inputs to a program. Increments to a resource base (e.g., newly trained personnel)
    are defined as outputs or outcomes. (A program output or outcome could be negative;
    for example, net depletion of a resource base). "

- label: Individual Performance Plan
  definition: "All employees, including managers and executives, are to operate under
    individual performance plans developed in coordination with their supervisors.
    These performance plans are to be specific, measurable (both in terms of quantity
    and quality), aligned, relevant/realistic and timed. When addressing alignment,
    the plan should directly link to the USACE Campaign Plan, Program Area Strategic
    Plans and Implementation Plans (and to Army and Defense goals and objectives to
    the extent possible). Each employee should be able to see how his or her work
    directly supports the organization's achievement of the USACE Campaign Plan
    goals and objectives."

- label: Management's Discussion and Analysis
  altName: [ MD&A, Civil Works Management Discussion and Analysis ]
  definition: "The MD&A of the must be concise, easy to read and utilize visual references
    to present summary information. The MD&A should include a table/ chart displaying
    historical performance trend data for the entity's strategic goals, and selected
    key performance measures associated with those goals should be included in the
    MD&A. Agencies should present performance information that facilitates analysis
    of trends over time and provides the most comprehensive picture of a program's
    performance history. Performance trend data should provide the Congress, the public
    and other stakeholders with sufficient information on how a program is progressing
    compared to its past achievements and shortfalls."

  anchor: '72'
- label: Outcome Measure
  definition: "Outcomes describe the intended result of carrying out a program or activity.
    They define an event or condition that is external to the program or activity
    and that is of direct importance to the intended beneficiaries and/or the public.
    For a tornado warning system, outcomes could be the number of lives saved and
    the property damage averted. While performance measures must distinguish between
    outcomes and outputs, there must be a reasonable connection between them, with
    the outputs supporting (i.e., leading to) outcomes in a logical fashion."
  anchor: '72'
- label: Performance Goal
  definition: "A performance goal is a target level of performance expressed as a tangible,
    measurable, objective against which actual achievement can be compared, including
    a goal expressed as a quantitative standard, value, or rate. The framers of the
    Government Performance Results Act of 1993 recognized that in rare instances it
    may not be feasible to measure the results of a federal program quantitatively.
    If an agency, in consultation with the Director of Office of Management and Budget,
    determines that it is not feasible to express performance goals for a particular
    program in an objective, quantifiable, measurable form, the Director of Office
    of Management and Budget may authorize an alternative form. Even with the alternative
    form, Government Performance Results Act of 1993 seeks clear statement of a program's
    goals and clear standards for identifying progress in meeting the goals. There
    may be several performance goals for any general goal in a strategic plan."
  anchor: '72'
- label: Performance Measures
  definition: "For most performance goals, a number of performance indicators should
    be developed -- preferably a range of related performance indicators (such as
    quantity, quality, timeliness, cost, and outcome) so that managers can balance
    priorities among competing subÂ­ goals. A performance measure is a particular
    value or characteristic used to indicate the program's output or outcome in
    relation to program goals. Under GPRA, an output measure is a tabulation, calculation,
    or recording of activity or effort and can be expressed in a quantitative or qualitative
    manner. Although the text of GPRA does not specify a distinction between outputs
    and activities, an important purpose of the Act is to focus attention beyond effort
    or activity in order to assess outputs and outcomes. Thus, OMB guidance differentiates
    between outputs (e.g., graduates) and production activities (e.g., teaching).
    An outcome measure is an assessment of the results of a program compared to its
    intended purpose."
  anchor: '72'
- label: Performance Plan
  definition: "A performance plan links measurable goals to budget during a fiscal
    year. The goals should reflect a level of accomplishment commensurate with the
    resources requested and subsequently funded. This plan includes performance goals
    for each set of activities, a summary of the resources necessary to reach those
    goals, performance indicators that will be used to measure performance in the
    future, and identification of how the measured values will be verified. Performance
    Plans are developed by the HQ program area. The program area performance plans
    are integrated into the USACE Performance Plan."

    a new document'”the Program Change Proposal (PCP)'”was introduced into the budgeting
    process to address urgent matters that need action during the off-budget year.
    The Military Services and Defense agencies use POM in the even-numbered on-budget
    years to develop proposed programs consistent with the Joint Programming Guidance
    (JPG) and to submit proposed programming. In addition to the current budget year,
    the POM is a seven-year plan that is organized within program categories, such
    as conventional forces or special operations; and by type of resource, such as
    funding or manpower. POM is reviewed by program review teams comprising members
    from the military departments, Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), defense agencies,
    and OSD staff. The results of this review are presented to the Senior Level Review
    Group (SLRG) for discussion. In addition, the Joint Chiefs conduct a concurrent
    checks-and-balances review of POM, focusing on the balance and capabilities of
    the proposed forces levels. Both reviews are presented to the Secretary of Defense
