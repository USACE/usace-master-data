- label: Accounting Support for Fund Control Systems
  definition: 'CEFMS II is a fully operational, integrated financial management system
    supporting agency fund control. This field-level financial management tool integrates
    USACE work management functions with accounting requirements prescribed under
    U.S. Government Standard General Ledger policies. All transactions which affect
    dollars (commitments, obligations, expenditures, disbursements) for all USACE
    missions and programs are entered into CEFMS II. CEFMS II records all transactions,
    stores records electronically for easy access and retrieval, and updates United
    States Standard General Ledgers based on each transaction. CEFMS II provides for:

    a. Recording all financial transactions affecting apportionments, reapportionments,
    allotments, agency restrictions, financial plans, program operating plans, obligations
    and expenditures as well as anticipated, earned, and collected reimbursements.

    b. Preparing and reconciling financial reports that display cumulative obligations
    and the remaining unobligated balance by appropriation and allotment and cumulative
    obligations by budget activity and object class.'

- label: ADA Reporting Procedures
  definition: The purpose of a potential ADA violation investigation is to determine
    if a violation has occurred. An ADA investigation is initiated by the applicable
    assigned individual or team and must be reported to the Army as required. One
    of the most important outcomes of an ADA investigation is preparing necessary
    reports.

  parentTopic: Finance/Budget
- label: ADA Violations
  definition: 'The three ADA statutes most frequently cited are title 31 USC sections
    1341, 1342, and 1517. Section 1341 prohibits a federal employee from making or
    authorizing an expenditure or obligation exceeding an amount available in an appropriation
    or fund. Section 1342 prohibits a federal employee from accepting voluntary services
    except for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of
    property. Similar to section 1341, section 1517 prohibits federal employees from
    making or authorizing an expenditure or obligation exceeding an apportionment
    or formal administrative subdivision of funds. Not all alleged violations unfold
    as actual violations of the ADA statutes; the alleged violations however represent
    trouble areas or pitfalls to be avoided.

    Any officer or employee of the United States is prohibited from:

    a. Making or authorizing an expenditure from, or creating or authorizing an obligation
    under, any appropriation or fund in excess of the amount available in the appropriation
    or fund unless authorized by law. Involving the government in any obligation to
    pay money before funds have been appropriated for that purpose, unless otherwise
    allowed by law.

    c. Accepting voluntary services for the U.S., or employing personal services not
    authorized by law except in cases of emergency involving the safety of human life
    or the protection of property.

    d. Making obligations or expenditures in excess of an apportionment or reapportionment
    or in excess of the amount permitted by agency regulations. A violation will also
    result from the over-expenditure of an appropriation, allotment, statutory limitation
    or earmark, or an obligation in advance of an appropriation.

    e. A violation of the ADA will occur from any of the actions above. Congress enacted
    the ADA to prevent the obligation of Government funds that are not available.'

- label: Administrative Penalties
  definition: The law provides that any officer or employee of the United States who
    violates the prohibitions of Title 31 USC 1341(a), 1342, 1349-1351, 1511-1516,
    1517(a)-1519 will be subject to administrative discipline. The DoD FMR contains
    additional guidance regarding recommended disciplinary actions. Administrative
    discipline for a civilian employee may include written admonishment or reprimand,
    reduction in grade, suspension from duty without pay, or removal from office.
    Military personnel may be subject to appropriate administrative discipline or
    may be subject to action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). If
    a violation is determined to have been knowingly and willfully committed, there
    are statutory provisions applying criminal penalties. An officer or employee found
    responsible for committing a violation knowingly and willfully may be subject
    to criminal penalties. The investigating officer should consult with legal counsel
    to determine if the investigation should be referred to the appropriate criminal
    investigation organization for action.

- label: Allotment
  definition: Subdivisions of apportionments that are made by the head of an agency.
    An allotment is an authority delegated by the head of the agency or other authorized
    employee to incur obligations within the specified amount consistent with the
    requirements in OMB Circular A-11. The amount allotted by an agency cannot exceed
    the amount apportioned by OMB. In USACE, the Director of Resource Management (DRM)
    or authorized designee is responsible for issuing, reducing, or changing the structure
    of allotments for Civil Works appropriations. The sum of a sub-allotment, a subdivision
    of an allotment, or amount issued cannot exceed the allotment amount. The amount
    of an allotment is fixed and cannot be changed except as otherwise authorized
    by the head of the agency or the DRM.

- label: Apportionment
  definition: Distribution of amounts made by OMB of amounts available for obligation
    in an appropriation or fund account into amounts available for specified time
    periods, programs, activities, projects, objects, or any combinations of these.
    The apportioned amount limits the obligations that may be incurred. An apportionment
    may be further subdivided by an agency into allotments, sub-allotments, and allocations.
    The OMB apportions funds from the Energy and Water Development and related agencies
    Appropriations Act to USACE making appropriated funds available for obligation
    and expenditure. The process of apportionment of funds for military appropriations,
    such as Operation and Maintenance, Army, can be found in Volume 14, Chapter 1
    of the DoD Financial Management Regulation (FMR). Apportionment restricts, by
    appropriation, the quarterly amounts available for obligation to ensure an orderly
    distribution of funds throughout the fiscal year. Included in the apportionment
    are newly appropriated funds, anticipated reimbursable activity, and unobligated
    balances carried over from prior year appropriations. The OMB may use apportionment
    to restrict the use of funds when the work intended by Congress is contrary to
    Administration policy or not legislatively authorized. The apportioned amount
    limits the obligations that may be incurred. An apportionment may be further subdivided
    into allotments, sub-allotments, and allocations all of which are subject to the
    provisions of the ADA. OMB may use apportionment to restrict the use of funds
    when the work intended by Congress is contrary to Administration policy or not
    legislatively authorized. Apportionments are subject to adjustment in the event
    of substantially increased allotments or major revocations, a Supplemental Appropriations
    Act, or if appropriations are deferred or rescinded according to the Congressional
    Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (PL 93-344). The head of an executive
    agency may request an apportionment under title 31 USC section 1512. This chapter
    serves as the governing directive on apportionments. Appendix F details the procedures
    for requesting the apportionment of funds in USACE. Congressional Budget and Impoundment
    Control Act of 1974 (PL 93-344).

- label: Preliminary Review
  definition: Army reviews the potential ADA flash report and determines whether a
    preliminary investigation is warranted after coordinating with Army General Counsel.
    If warranted, DASA-FO will direct CERM-F to initiate a preliminary investigation
    and a case number is assigned. To help assure independence and impartiality during
    the review, CERM-F selects an investigator from an organization external to the
    USACE activity being reviewed. Investigating Officer is appointed by the USACE
    Deputy Commanding General. DASA- FO memorandum will assign a date to complete
    preliminary review. Per DoD FMR, preliminary review should be completed within
    14 weeks from the date of initial discovery. The USACE activity that reported
    the alleged violation is responsible for all the costs for the investigating officer.
    CERM-F coordinates with HQ Legal Counsel to obtain a Legal Sufficiency letter
    that is submitted to DASA-FO along with the preliminary report. The preliminary
    review must focus on the potential violation not the corrective actions. Applicable
    corrective actions will be developed during the formal investigation, if formal
    investigation is warranted. The preliminary investigator or the review team lead
    must be capable of conducting a complete, impartial, and unbiased review.

    type or any component in a breakdown thereof. Resource codes are also tied to
    object classes. Resource codes may only belong to one object class, with the exception
    of OTHCONSVC, which maybe in 25% or 32%, due to the nature of this resource code
